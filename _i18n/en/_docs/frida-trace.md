## -U, --usb: connect to USB device

This option tells `frida-trace` to perform tracing on a remote device
connected via the host machine's USB connection.

Example: You want to trace an application running on an Android device
from your host Windows machine.  If you specify `-U / --usb`,
frida-trace will perform the necessary work to transfer all data to
and from the remote device and trace accordingly.

<div class="note">
  <h5>Copy frida-server binary to remote device</h5>
  <p>When tracing a remote device, remember to copy the
  <a href="https://github.com/frida/frida/releases">platform-appropriate frida-server binary</a>
  to the remote device.  Once copied, be sure to run the frida-server binary before
  beginning the tracing session.</p>
  <p>For example, to trace a remote Android application, you might copy the
  'frida-server-12.8.0-android-arm' binary to the Android's /data/local/tmp
  folder.  Using adb shell, you would run the server in the background
  (e.g. "frida-server-12.8.0-android-arm &").</p>
</div>

## -O: pass command line options via text file

Using this option, you can pass any number of command line options via one or
more text files.  The options in the text file can be on one or more lines, with
any number of options per line, including other `-O` command options.

This feature is useful for handling a large number of command line options, and
solves the problem when the command line exceeds the operating system maximum
command line length.

For example:

{% highlight console %}
$ frida-trace -p 9753 --decorate -O additional-options.txt
{% endhighlight %}

where additional-options.txt is:

{% highlight console %}
-i "gdi32full.dll!ExtTextOutW"
-S core.js -S ms-windows.js
-O module-offset-options.txt
{% endhighlight %}

and module-offset-options.txt is:

{% highlight console %}
-a "gdi32full.dll!0x3918DC" -a "gdi32full.dll!0xBE7458"
-a "gdi32full.dll!0xBF9904"
{% endhighlight %}

## -I, -X: include/exclude module

These options allow you to include or exclude, in one single option, **all**
functions in a particular module (e.g., *.so, *.dll) in one, single option.
The option expects a filename glob for matching one or more modules.  Any
module that matches the glob pattern will be either included or excluded in its
entirety.

`frida-trace` will generate a JavaScript handler file for each function matched
by the `-I` option.

To exclude specific functions after including an entire module, see the `-x`
option.

## -i, -x: include/exclude function (glob-based)

These options enable you to include or exclude matching functions according to
your needs.  These are flexible options, allowing a granularity ranging from
**all** functions in **all** modules down to a single function in a specific module.

`frida-trace` will generate a JavaScript handler file for each function matched
by the `-i` option.

The `-i / -x` options differ syntactically from their uppercase counterparts
in that they accept any of the following forms (MODULE and FUNCTION are both
glob patterns):

<pre style="font-family: monospace;">
- MODULE!FUNCTION
- FUNCTION
- !FUNCTION
- MODULE!
</pre>

Here are some examples and their descriptions:

| Option Value          | Description                                                      |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| -i "msvcrt.dll!*cpy*" | Matches all functions with 'cpy' in its name, ONLY in msvcrt.dll |
| -i "*free*"           | Matches all functions with 'free' in its name in ALL modules     |
| -i "!*free*"          | Identical to -i "*free*"                                         |
| -i "gdi32.dll!"       | Trace all functions in gdi32.dll (identical to -I "gdi32.dll")   |

<div class="note info">
  <h5>frida-trace's working set and the order of inclusions and exclusions</h5>
  <p>frida-trace has an internal concept of a "working set", i.e., a set of
  "module:function" pairs whose handlers will be traced at runtime.  The
  contents of the working set can be changed by an include / exclude command
  line option (-I / -X / -i / -x).</p>
  <p>It is important to understand that the order of the include / exclude
  options is important.  Each such option works on the current state of the
  working set, and different orderings of options can lead to
  different results.  In other words, the include/exclude options are procedural
  (i.e., order counts) rather than simply declarative.</p>
  <p>For example, suppose we want to trace all "str*" and "mem*" functions in
  all modules in a running process.  In our example, these functions are found
  in  three modules: <i>ucrtbase.dll, ntdll.dll, and msvcrt.dll</i>.  To reduce the
  noise, however, we do not want to trace any functions found in the msvcrt.dll
  module.</p>
  <p>We will describe three different option orders on the command line and
  show that they produce different results.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><div style="font-family: monospace">-i "str*" -i "mem*" -X "msvcrt.dll"
        </div></li>
      <ul>
        <li><div style="font-family: monospace">'-i "str*"'</div> matches 80
            functions in 3 modules, working set has 80 entries</li>
        <li><div style="font-family: monospace">'-i "mem*"'</div> matches 18
            functions in 3 modules, working set has 98 entries</li>
        <li><div style="font-family: monospace">'-X "msvcrt.dll"'</div> removes
            the 28 "str" and 6 "mem" functions originating in msvcrt.dll,
            <b>final working set has 64 entries</b>.</li>
      </ul>
    <li><div style="font-family: monospace">-i "str*" -X "msvcrt.dll" -i "mem*"
        </div></li>
      <ul>
        <li><div style="font-family: monospace">'-i "str*"'</div> matches 80
            functions in 3 modules, working set has 80 entries</li>
        <li><div style="font-family: monospace">'-X "msvcrt.dll"'</div> removes
            the 28 "str" functions originating in msvcrt.dll, working set has 52
            entries.</li>
        <li><div style="font-family: monospace">'-i "mem*"'</div> matches 18
            functions in 3 modules including msvcrt.dll, <b>final working set
            has 70 entries</b></li>
      </ul>
    <li><div style="font-family: monospace">-X "msvcrt.dll" -i "str*" -i "mem*"
        </div></li>
      <ul>
        <li><div style="font-family: monospace">'-X "msvcrt.dll"'</div> tries to
            remove the 28 "str" and 6 "mem" functions originating in msvcrt.dll.
            Since the working set is empty, there is nothing to remove, working
            set has 0 entries.</li>
        <li><div style="font-family: monospace">'-i "str*"'</div> matches 80
            functions in 3 modules, working set has 80 entries</li>
        <li><div style="font-family: monospace">'-i "mem*"'</div> matches 18
            functions in 3 modules, <b>final working set has 98 entries</b></li>
      </ul>
  </ul>
</div>

## -a: include function (offset-based)

This option enables tracing functions whose names are not exported by their
parent modules (e.g., a static C/C++ function).  This should not prevent you
from tracing such functions, so long as you know the absolute offset of that
function's entry point.

Example: `-a "libjpeg.so!0x4793c"`

In this example, the option's value provides both the full name of the module
(i.e., `libjpeg.so`) and the hex offset (`0x4793c`) of the function entry point
within the module.

`frida-trace` will generate a JavaScript handler file for each function matched
by the `-a` option.

## -P: Initialize frida-trace session with a globally-accessible JSON object

This option enables assigning a JSON object to the `parameters` global variable.
Your handlers can access this global variable, enabling you to dynamically
change the handlers' behavior by modifying the value of `-P` passed on the
command line.

The JSON object passed can be as complicated or extensive as you wish, so long
as it is valid JSON.

<div class="note">
  <h5>Example</h5>
  <p>
    In your session, you are tracing many functions.  At times you want all
    handlers to print out their process ID.  Using the `-P` option, you can
    enable a handler to decide whether or not to print the process ID.
  </p>
  <p>
    First, decide on the JSON object format that notifies a handler whether it
    should display the process ID.  Let's use the following format:

    <br>
    <br>
    <div style="font-family: monospace; text-indent: 40px">
      -P '{"displayPid": true}'
    </div>
    <br>

    Note that this form is the one you might use under Linux (i.e., you can use
    both single- and double-quotes on the command line).  Under Windows you can
    only use double quotes, so you should escape the inner double quotes by
    inserting <b>two</b> double quotes, like this:

    <br>
    <br>
    <div style="font-family: monospace; text-indent: 40px">
      -P "{""displayPid"": true}"
    </div>
    <br>

    Frida-trace will assign your JSON object to the global JavaScript variable
    "<i>parameters</i>".  Now, your handler can check the parameters.displayPid
    variable to decide whether to print the process ID:

    <br>
    <br>

    <code>{
  onEnter(log, args, state) {
    log('memcpy() [msvcrt.dll]');
    if (parameters.displayPid) {
      log(`Process ID: ${Process.id}`);
    }
  },

  onLeave(log, retval, state) {
  }
}
</code>

    <br>
  </p>
</div>

## -S: Initialize frida-trace session with JavaScript code

This option initializes your frida-trace session by executing one or more
JavaScript code files of your choice, which may declare globally visible
functions and add arbitrary data to the global "state" object.  When the "state"
object is passed to any of your handlers, you have immediate access to anything
you saved to it during session initialization.

Uses of this powerful feature include initializing the frida-trace running
environment before the session begins, and sharing finely-tuned and debugged
JavaScript functions and data that can be invoked across different handlers and
development projects.

For a detailed explanation of how to use this powerful feature, consult the
[session initialization primer]({% link _docs/frida-trace/session-initialization-primer.md %}).

## -d, --decorate: add module name to log tracing

The `--decorate` option is relevant when `frida-trace` auto-generates JavaScript
handler scripts.  By default, a handler's `onEnter` function looks like this:

<code>onEnter(log, args, state) {
  log('memcpy()');
},
</code>

The drawback is that, if the same function name exists in multiple modules,
it will be difficult to differentiate between function traces.  The `--decorate`
function instructs `frida-trace` to insert the module name in the default
`onEnter` trace instruction:

<code>onEnter(log, args, state) {
  log('memcpy() [msvcrt.dll]');
},
</code>
