Frida was born after [@oleavr][] and [@hsorbo][] had been casually
brainstorming about how they wish they could turn tedious manual
reverse-engineering into something much more fun, productive, and interactive.

Having built [oSpy][] and other custom tools to scratch reverse-engineering
itches, [@oleavr][] started piecing together [frida-gum][], a generic
cross-platform code-instrumentation library for C. At the time it was limited to
hooking functions and providing some tools to help developers write unit-tests
for memory leaks and profiling on an extremely granular level. Later it was
further improved and used to create Frida. The component [frida-core][] would
take care of all the nitty gritty details of injecting shared libraries into
arbitrary processes, and maintaining a live two-way channel with the injected
code running inside those processes. Inside that payload, [frida-gum][] would
take care of hooking functions and providing a scripting runtime using Google's
excellent [V8][] engine.

Later, in their not-so-ample spare time, [@oleavr][] and [@karltk][] did some
recreational pair-programming-hackathons that resulted in [huge improvements][]
to [frida-gum][]'s code tracing engine, the so-called [Stalker][]. There were
also Python bindings created. They started realizing that it was about time
that people out there knew about the project, so further hackathons were devoted
to piecing together a website and some much needed documentation.

Today, Frida should be a very helpful toolbox for anyone interested in dynamic
instrumentation and/or reverse-engineering. There are now language bindings
for [Node.js][], [Python][], [Swift][], [.NET][], [Qt/Qml][], and it is also
possible to use Frida from C.
