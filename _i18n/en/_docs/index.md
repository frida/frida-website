This site aims to be a comprehensive guide to Frida. We’ll cover topics such
as doing interactive function tracing from the command-line, building your own
tools on top of Frida's APIs, and give you some advice on participating in the
future development of Frida itself.

## So what is Frida, exactly?

It's
[Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) for
native apps, or, put in more technical terms, it's a dynamic code
instrumentation toolkit. It lets you inject snippets of JavaScript or your own
library into native apps on Windows, macOS, GNU/Linux, iOS, Android, and QNX.
Frida also provides you with some simple tools built on top of the Frida API.
These can be used as-is, tweaked to your needs, or serve as examples of how to
use the API.

## Why do I need this?

Great question. We'll try to clarify with some use-cases:

- There's this new hot app everybody's so excited about, but it's only
  available for iOS and you'd love to interop with it. You realize it's
  relying on encrypted network protocols and tools like Wireshark just
  won't cut it. You pick up Frida and use it for API tracing.
- You're building a desktop app which has been deployed at a customer's site.
  There's a problem but the built-in logging code just isn't enough. You
  need to send your customer a custom build with lots of expensive logging
  code. Then you realize you could just use Frida and build an application-
  specific tool that will add all the diagnostics you need, and in just a
  few lines of Python. No need to send the customer a new custom build - you
  just send the tool which will work on many versions of your app.
- You'd like to build a Wireshark on steroids with support for sniffing
  encrypted protocols. It could even manipulate function calls to fake network
  conditions that would otherwise require you to set up a test lab.
- Your in-house app could use some black-box tests without polluting your
  production code with logic only required for exotic testing.

## Why a Python API, but JavaScript debugging logic?

Frida's core is written in C and injects [Google's V8
engine](https://developers.google.com/v8/) into the target processes, where your
JS gets executed with full access to memory, hooking functions and even calling
native functions inside the process. There's a bi-directional communication
channel that is used to talk between your app and the JS running inside the
target process.

Using Python and JS allows for quick development with a risk-free API. Frida can
help you easily catch errors in JS and provide you an exception rather than
crashing.

Rather not write in Python?  No problem.  You can use Frida from C directly, and
on top of this C core there are multiple language bindings, e.g.
[Node.js](https://github.com/frida/frida-node),
[Python](https://github.com/frida/frida-python),
[Swift](https://github.com/frida/frida-swift),
[.NET](https://github.com/frida/frida-clr),
[Qml](https://github.com/frida/frida-qml), etc.  It is very easy to build
additional bindings for other languages and environments.

## ProTips™, Notes, and Warnings
