## Getting started

To be more productive, we highly recommend using our **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**
bindings. This means you get code completion, type checking, inline docs,
refactoring tools, etc.

Here's a short teaser video showing the editor experience:

## Runtime information

### Frida

+   `Frida.version`: property containing the current Frida version, as a string.

+   `Frida.heapSize`: dynamic property containing the current size of Frida's
    private heap, shared by all scripts and Frida's own runtime. This is useful
    for keeping an eye on how much memory your instrumentation is using out of
    the total consumed by the hosting process.

### Script

+   `Script.runtime`: string property containing the runtime being used.
    Either `QJS` or `V8`.

+   `Script.pin()`: temporarily prevents the current script from being unloaded.
    This is reference-counted, so there must be one matching *unpin()* happening
    at a later point. Typically used in the callback of *bindWeak()* when you
    need to schedule cleanup on another thread.

+   `Script.unpin()`: reverses a previous *pin()* so the current script may be
    unloaded.

+   `Script.bindWeak(value, fn)`: monitors `value` and calls the `fn` callback
    as soon as `value` has been garbage-collected, or the script is about to get
    unloaded. Returns an ID that you can pass to [`Script.unbindWeak()`](#unbindweak)
    for explicit cleanup.
    {: #bindweak}

    This API is useful if you're building a language-binding, where you need to
    free native resources when a JS value is no longer needed.

+   `Script.unbindWeak(id)`: stops monitoring the value passed to
    `Script.bindWeak(value, fn)`, and call the `fn` callback immediately.
    {: #unbindweak}

+   `Script.setGlobalAccessHandler(handler | null)`: installs or uninstalls a
    handler that is used to resolve attempts to access non-existent global
    variables. Useful for implementing a REPL where unknown identifiers may be
    fetched lazily from a database.

    The `handler` is an object containing two properties:

    -   `enumerate()`: queries which additional globals exist. Must return an
                       array of strings.
    -   `get(property)`: retrieves the value for the given property.

---

## Process, Thread, Module and Memory

### Thread

+   `Thread.backtrace([context, backtracer])`: generate a backtrace for the
    current thread, returned as an array of [`NativePointer`](#nativepointer) objects.
    {: #thread-backtrace}

    If you call this from Interceptor's [`onEnter`](#interceptor-onenter) or
    [`onLeave`](#interceptor-onleave) callbacks you
    should provide `this.context` for the optional `context` argument, as it
    will give you a more accurate backtrace. Omitting `context` means the
    backtrace will be generated from the current stack location, which may
    not give you a very good backtrace due to the JavaScript VM's stack frames.
    The optional `backtracer` argument specifies the kind of backtracer to use,
    and must be either `Backtracer.FUZZY` or `Backtracer.ACCURATE`, where the
    latter is the default if not specified. The accurate kind of backtracers
    rely on debugger-friendly binaries or presence of debug information to do a
    good job, whereas the fuzzy backtracers perform forensics on the stack in
    order to guess the return addresses, which means you will get false
    positives, but it will work on any binary. The generated backtrace is 
    currently limited to 16 frames and is not adjustable without recompiling
    Frida.

{% highlight js %}
const f = Module.getExportByName('libcommonCrypto.dylib',
    'CCCryptorCreate');
Interceptor.attach(f, {
  onEnter(args) {
    console.log('CCCryptorCreate called from:\n' +
        Thread.backtrace(this.context, Backtracer.ACCURATE)
        .map(DebugSymbol.fromAddress).join('\n') + '\n');
  }
});
{% endhighlight %}

+   `Thread.sleep(delay)`: suspend execution of the current thread for `delay`
    seconds specified as a number. For example 0.05 to sleep for 50 ms.

### Process

+   `Process.id`: property containing the PID as a number

+   `Process.arch`: property containing the string `ia32`, `x64`, `arm`
    or `arm64`
    {: #process-arch}

+   `Process.platform`: property containing the string `windows`,
    `darwin`, `linux` or `qnx`

+   `Process.pageSize`: property containing the size of a virtual memory page
    (in bytes) as a number. This is used to make your scripts more portable.
    {: #process-pagesize}

+   `Process.pointerSize`: property containing the size of a pointer
    (in bytes) as a number. This is used to make your scripts more portable.
    {: #process-pointersize}

+   `Process.codeSigningPolicy`: property containing the string `optional` or
    `required`, where the latter means Frida will avoid modifying existing code
    in memory and will not try to run unsigned code. Currently this property
    will always be set to `optional` unless you are using **[Gadget](/docs/gadget)**
    and have configured it to assume that code-signing is required. This
    property allows you to determine whether the **[Interceptor](#interceptor)** API
    is off limits, and whether it is safe to modify code or run unsigned code.

+   `Process.isDebuggerAttached()`: returns a boolean indicating whether a
    debugger is currently attached

+   `Process.getCurrentThreadId()`: get this thread's OS-specific id as a number

+   `Process.enumerateThreads()`: enumerates all threads, returning an array of
    objects containing the following properties:

    -   `id`: OS-specific id
    -   `state`: string specifying either `running`, `stopped`, `waiting`,
        `uninterruptible` or `halted`
    -   `context`: object with the keys `pc` and `sp`, which are
        **[NativePointer](#nativepointer)** objects specifying EIP/RIP/PC and
        ESP/RSP/SP, respectively, for ia32/x64/arm. Other processor-specific keys
        are also available, e.g. `eax`, `rax`, `r0`, `x0`, etc.

+   `Process.findModuleByAddress(address)`,
    `Process.getModuleByAddress(address)`,
    `Process.findModuleByName(name)`,
    `Process.getModuleByName(name)`:
    returns a **[Module](#module)** whose *address* or *name* matches the one
    specified. In the event that no such module could be found, the
    *find*-prefixed functions return *null* whilst the *get*-prefixed functions
    throw an exception.
    {: #process-getmodulebyname}

+   `Process.enumerateModules()`: enumerates modules loaded right now, returning
    an array of **[Module](#module)** objects.
    {: #process-enumeratemodules}

+   `Process.findRangeByAddress(address)`, `getRangeByAddress(address)`:
    return an object with details about the range containing *address*. In the
    event that no such range could be found, *findRangeByAddress()* returns
    *null* whilst *getRangeByAddress()* throws an exception.  See
    [`Process.enumerateRanges()`](#process-enumerateranges) for details about which
    fields are included.

+   `Process.enumerateRanges(protection|specifier)`: enumerates memory ranges
    satisfying `protection` given as a string of the form: `rwx`, where `rw-`
    means "must be at least readable and writable". Alternatively you may
    provide a `specifier` object with a `protection` key whose value is as
    aforementioned, and a `coalesce` key set to `true` if you'd like neighboring
    ranges with the same protection to be coalesced (the default is `false`;
    i.e. keeping the ranges separate). Returns an array of objects containing
    the following properties:
    {: #process-enumerateranges}

    -   `base`: base address as a [`NativePointer`](#nativepointer)
    -   `size`: size in bytes
    -   `protection`: protection string (see above)
    -   `file`: (when available) file mapping details as an object
        containing:

        -   `path`: full filesystem path as a string
        -   `offset`: offset in the mapped file on disk, in bytes
        -   `size`: size in the mapped file on disk, in bytes

+   `Process.enumerateMallocRanges()`: just like [`enumerateRanges()`](#process-enumerateranges),
    but for individual memory allocations known to the system heap.

+   `Process.setExceptionHandler(callback)`: install a process-wide exception
    handler callback that gets a chance to handle native exceptions before the
    hosting process itself does. Called with a single argument, `details`, that
    is an object containing:
    {: #process-setexceptionhandler}

    -   `type`: string specifying one of:
        * abort
        * access-violation
        * guard-page
        * illegal-instruction
        * stack-overflow
        * arithmetic
        * breakpoint
        * single-step
        * system
    -   `address`: address where the exception occurred, as a **[NativePointer](#nativepointer)**
    -   `memory`: if present, is an object containing:
        -   `operation`: the kind of operation that triggered the exception, as
            a string specifying either `read`, `write`, or `execute`
        -   `address`: address that was accessed when the exception occurred, as
            a **[NativePointer](#nativepointer)**
    -   `context`: object with the keys `pc` and `sp`, which are
        **[NativePointer](#nativepointer)** objects specifying EIP/RIP/PC and
        ESP/RSP/SP, respectively, for ia32/x64/arm. Other processor-specific keys
        are also available, e.g. `eax`, `rax`, `r0`, `x0`, etc.
        You may also update register values by assigning to these keys.
    -   `nativeContext`: address of the OS and architecture-specific CPU context
        struct, as a **[NativePointer](#nativepointer)**. This is only exposed as a
        last resort for edge-cases where `context` isn't providing enough details. We
        would however discourage using this and rather submit a pull-request to add
        the missing bits needed for your use-case.

    It is up to your callback to decide what to do with the exception. It could
    log the issue, notify your application through a **[send()](#communication-send)**
    followed by a blocking recv() for acknowledgement of the sent data being received,
    or it can modify registers and memory to recover from the exception. You should
    return `true` if you did handle the exception, in which case Frida will
    resume the thread immediately. If you do not return `true`, Frida will
    forward the exception to the hosting process' exception handler, if it has
    one, or let the OS terminate the process.


### Module

Objects returned by e.g. [`Module.load()`](#module-load) and [`Process.enumerateModules()`](#process-enumeratemodules).<br/><br/>

-   `name`: canonical module name as a string

-   `base`: base address as a [`NativePointer`](#nativepointer)

-   `size`: size in bytes

-   `path`: full filesystem path as a string

-   `enumerateImports()`: enumerates imports of module, returning an array of
    objects containing the following properties:

    -   `type`: string specifying either `function` or `variable`
    -   `name`: import name as a string
    -   `module`: module name as a string
    -   `address`: absolute address as a [`NativePointer`](#nativepointer)
    -   `slot`: memory location where the import is stored, as a
        [`NativePointer`](#nativepointer)

    Only the `name` field is guaranteed to be present for all imports. The
    platform-specific backend will do its best to resolve the other fields
    even beyond what the native metadata provides, but there is no guarantee
    that it will succeed.

-   `enumerateExports()`: enumerates exports of module, returning an array
    of objects containing the following properties:

    -   `type`: string specifying either `function` or `variable`
    -   `name`: export name as a string
    -   `address`: absolute address as a [`NativePointer`](#nativepointer)

-   `enumerateSymbols()`: enumerates symbols of module, returning an array of
    objects containing the following properties:

    -   `isGlobal`: boolean specifying whether symbol is globally visible
    -   `type`: string specifying one of:
        -   unknown
        -   section
        -   undefined (Mach-O)
        -   absolute (Mach-O)
        -   prebound-undefined (Mach-O)
        -   indirect (Mach-O)
        -   object (ELF)
        -   function (ELF)
        -   file (ELF)
        -   common (ELF)
        -   tls (ELF)
    -   `section`: if present, is an object containing:
        -   `id`: string containing section index, segment name (if
                  applicable) and section name – same format as
                  [r2][]'s section IDs
        -   `protection`: protection like in [`Process.enumerateRanges()`](#process-enumerateranges)
    -   `name`: symbol name as a string
    -   `address`: absolute address as a [`NativePointer`](#nativepointer)
    -   `size`: if present, a number specifying the symbol's size in bytes

<div class="note info">
  <h5>enumerateSymbols() is only available on i/macOS and Linux-based OSes</h5>
  <p markdown="1">
    We would love to support this on the other platforms too, so if you find
    this useful and would like to help out, please get in touch. You may also
    find the **[DebugSymbol](#debugsymbol)** API adequate, depending on your use-case.
  </p>
</div>

-   `enumerateRanges(protection)`: just like [`Process.enumerateRanges`](#process-enumerateranges),
    except it's scoped to the module.

-   `findExportByName(exportName)`,
    `getExportByName(exportName)`: returns the absolute address of the export
    named `exportName`. In the event that no such export could be found, the
    *find*-prefixed function returns *null* whilst the *get*-prefixed function
    throws an exception.

+   `Module.load(path)`: loads the specified module from the filesystem path
    and returns a [`Module`](#module) object. Throws an exception if the specified
    module cannot be loaded.
    {: #module-load}

+   `Module.ensureInitialized(name)`: ensures that initializers of the specified
    module have been run. This is important during early instrumentation, i.e.
    code run early in the process lifetime, to be able to safely interact with
    APIs. One such use-case is interacting with **[ObjC](#objc)** classes provided
    by a given module.

+   `Module.findBaseAddress(name)`,
    `Module.getBaseAddress(name)`: returns the base address of the `name`
    module. In the event that no such module could be found, the *find*-prefixed
    function returns *null* whilst the *get*-prefixed function throws an
    exception.

+   `Module.findExportByName(moduleName|null, exportName)`,
    `Module.getExportByName(moduleName|null, exportName)`: returns the absolute
    address of the export named `exportName` in `moduleName`. If the module
    isn't known you may pass `null` instead of its name, but this can be a
    costly search and should be avoided. In the event that no such module or
    export could be found, the *find*-prefixed function returns *null* whilst
    the *get*-prefixed function throws an exception.
    {: #module-getexportbyname}


### ModuleMap

+   `new ModuleMap([filter])`: create a new module map optimized for determining
    which module a given memory address belongs to, if any. Takes a snapshot of
    the currently loaded modules when created, which may be refreshed by calling
    [`update()`](#modulemap-update). The `filter` argument is optional and allows
    you to pass a function used for filtering the list of modules. This is useful if
    you e.g. only care about modules owned by the application itself, and allows you
    to quickly check if an address belongs to one of its modules. The `filter`
    function is passed a **[Module](#module)** object and must return `true` for
    each module that should be kept in the map. It is called for each loaded
    module every time the map is updated.

-   `has(address)`: check if `address` belongs to any of the contained modules,
    and returns the result as a boolean

-   `find(address)`, `get(address)`: returns a **[Module](#module)** with details
    about the module that `address` belongs to. In the event that no such module
    could be found, `find()` returns `null` whilst `get()` throws an exception.
    {: #modulemap-find}

-   `findName(address)`,
    `getName(address)`,
    `findPath(address)`,
    `getPath(address)`:
    just like [`find()`](#modulemap-find) and [`get()`](#modulemap-find), but only
    returns the `name` or `path` field, which means less overhead when you don't need
    the other details.

-   `update()`: update the map. You should call this after a module has been
    loaded or unloaded to avoid operating on stale data.
    {: #modulemap-update}

-   `values()`: returns an array with the **[Module](#module)** objects currently in
    the map. The returned array is a deep copy and will not mutate after a call
    to [`update()`](#modulemap-update).


### Memory

+   `Memory.scan(address, size, pattern, callbacks)`: scan memory for
    occurrences of `pattern` in the memory range given by `address` and `size`.
    {: #memory-scan}

    -   `pattern` must be of the form "13 37 ?? ff" to match 0x13 followed by
        0x37 followed by any byte followed by 0xff.
        For more advanced matching it is also possible to specify an
        [r2][]-style mask. The mask is bitwise AND-ed against both the needle
        and the haystack. To specify the mask append a `:` character after the
        needle, followed by the mask using the same syntax.
        For example: "13 37 13 37 : 1f ff ff f1".
        For convenience it is also possible to specify nibble-level wildcards,
        like "?3 37 13 ?7", which gets translated into masks behind the scenes.

    -   `callbacks` is an object with:

        -   `onMatch(address, size)`: called with `address` containing the
            address of the occurence as a [`NativePointer`](#nativepointer) and
            `size` specifying the size as a number.

            This function may return the string `stop` to cancel the memory
            scanning early.

        -   `onError(reason)`: called with `reason` when there was a memory
            access error while scanning

        -   `onComplete()`: called when the memory range has been fully scanned

-   `Memory.scanSync(address, size, pattern)`: synchronous version of [`scan()`](#memory-scan)
    that returns an array of objects containing the following properties:

    -   `address`: absolute address as a [`NativePointer`](#nativepointer).
    -   `size`: size in bytes

    For example:

{% highlight js %}
// Find the module for the program itself, always at index 0:
const m = Process.enumerateModules()[0];

// Or load a module by name:
//const m = Module.load('win32u.dll');

// Print its properties:
console.log(JSON.stringify(m));

// Dump it from its base address:
console.log(hexdump(m.base));

// The pattern that you are interested in:
const pattern = '00 00 00 00 ?? 13 37 ?? 42';

Memory.scan(m.base, m.size, pattern, {
  onMatch(address, size) {
    console.log('Memory.scan() found match at', address,
        'with size', size);

    // Optionally stop scanning early:
    return 'stop';
  },
  onComplete() {
    console.log('Memory.scan() complete');
  }
});

const results = Memory.scanSync(m.base, m.size, pattern);
console.log('Memory.scanSync() result:\n' +
    JSON.stringify(results));
{% endhighlight %}

+   `Memory.alloc(size[, options])`: allocate `size` bytes of memory on the
    heap, or, if `size` is a multiple of
    [`Process.pageSize`](#process-pagesize), one or more raw memory pages
    managed by the OS. When using page granularity you may also specify an
    `options` object if you need the memory allocated close to a given address,
    by specifying `{ near: address, maxDistance: distanceInBytes }`.
    The returned value is a [`NativePointer`](#nativepointer) and the underlying
    memory will be released when all JavaScript handles to it are gone. This
    means you need to keep a reference to it while the pointer is being used by
    code outside the JavaScript runtime.
    {: #memory-alloc}

+   `Memory.copy(dst, src, n)`: just like memcpy(). Returns nothing.
    {: #memory-copy}

    - dst: a [`NativePointer`](#nativepointer) specifying the destination base address.
    - src: a [`NativePointer`](#nativepointer) specifying the source base address.
    - n: size in bytes to be copied.

+   `Memory.dup(address, size)`: short-hand for [`Memory.alloc()`](#memory-alloc)
    followed by [`Memory.copy()`](#memory-copy). Returns a [`NativePointer`](#nativepointer)
    containing the base address of the freshly allocated memory. See [`Memory.copy()`](#memory-copy)
    for details on the memory allocation's lifetime.

+   `Memory.protect(address, size, protection)`: update protection on a region
    of memory, where `protection` is a string of the same format as
    [`Process.enumerateRanges()`](#process-enumerateranges).

    Returns a boolean indicating whether the operation completed successfully.

    For example:

{% highlight js %}
Memory.protect(ptr('0x1234'), 4096, 'rw-');
{% endhighlight %}

+   `Memory.patchCode(address, size, apply)`: safely modify `size` bytes at
    `address`, specified as a **[NativePointer](#nativepointer)**. The supplied
    JavaScript function `apply` gets called with a writable pointer where you must
    write the desired modifications before returning. Do not make any assumptions
    about this being the same location as `address`, as some systems require
    modifications to be written to a temporary location before being mapped into
    memory on top of the original memory page (e.g. on iOS, where directly modifying
    in-memory code may result in the process losing its CS_VALID status).
    {: #memory-patchcode}

    For example:

{% highlight js %}
const getLivesLeft = Module.getExportByName('game-engine.so', 'get_lives_left');
const maxPatchSize = 64; // Do not write out of bounds, may be a temporary buffer!
Memory.patchCode(getLivesLeft, maxPatchSize, code => {
  const cw = new X86Writer(code, { pc: getLivesLeft });
  cw.putMovRegU32('eax', 9000);
  cw.putRet();
  cw.flush();
});
{% endhighlight %}

+   `Memory.allocUtf8String(str)`,
    `Memory.allocUtf16String(str)`,
    `Memory.allocAnsiString(str)`:
    allocate, encode and write out `str` as a UTF-8/UTF-16/ANSI string on the
    heap. The returned object is a [`NativePointer`](#nativepointer). See
    [`Memory.alloc()`](#memory-alloc) for details about its lifetime.


### MemoryAccessMonitor

+   `MemoryAccessMonitor.enable(ranges, callbacks)`: monitor one or more memory
    ranges for access, and notify on the first access of each contained memory
    page. `ranges` is either a single range object or an array of such objects,
    each of which contains:
    {: #memoryaccessmonitor-enable}

    -   `base`: base address as a [`NativePointer`](#nativepointer)
    -   `size`: size in bytes

    `callbacks` is an object specifying:

    -   `onAccess(details)`: called synchronously with `details` object
        containing:
        -   `operation`: the kind of operation that triggered the access, as a
            string specifying either `read`, `write`, or `execute`
        -   `from`: address of instruction performing the access as a
            [`NativePointer`](#nativepointer)
        -   `address`: address being accessed as a [`NativePointer`](#nativepointer)
        -   `rangeIndex`: index of the accessed range in the ranges provided to
            `MemoryAccessMonitor.enable()`
        -   `pageIndex`: index of the accessed memory page inside the specified
            range
        -   `pagesCompleted`: overall number of pages which have been accessed
            so far (and are no longer being monitored)
        -   `pagesTotal`: overall number of pages that were initially monitored

+   `MemoryAccessMonitor.disable()`: stop monitoring the remaining memory ranges
    passed to [`MemoryAccessMonitor.enable()`](#memoryaccessmonitor-enable).


### CModule

+   `new CModule(code[, symbols, options])`: creates a new C module from the
    provided `code`, either a string containing the C source code to compile, or
    an ArrayBuffer containing a precompiled shared library. The C module gets
    mapped into memory and becomes fully accessible to JavaScript.

    Useful for implementing hot callbacks, e.g. for **[Interceptor](#interceptor)**
    and **[Stalker](#stalker)**, but also useful when needing to start new threads
    in order to call functions in a tight loop, e.g. for fuzzing purposes.

    Global functions are automatically exported as **[NativePointer](#nativepointer)**
    properties named exactly like in the C source code. This means you can pass them
    to **[Interceptor](#interceptor)** and **[Stalker](#stalker)**, or call them
    using **[NativePointer](#nativepointer)**.

    In addition to accessing a curated subset of Gum, GLib, and standard C APIs,
    the code being mapped in can also communicate with JavaScript through the
    `symbols` exposed to it. This is the optional second argument, an object
    specifying additional symbol names and their
    **[NativePointer](#nativepointer)** values, each of which will be plugged in
    at creation. This may for example be one or more memory blocks allocated
    using **[Memory.alloc()](#memory-alloc)**, and/or
    **[NativeCallback](#nativecallback)** values for receiving callbacks from
    the C module.

    To perform initialization and cleanup, you may define functions with the
    following names and signatures:

    -   `void init (void)`
    -   `void finalize (void)`

    Note that all data is read-only, so writable globals should be declared
    *extern*, allocated using e.g. **[Memory.alloc()](#memory-alloc)**, and passed
    in as symbols through the constructor's second argument.

    The optional third argument, `options`, is an object that may be used to
    specify which toolchain to use, e.g.: `{ toolchain: 'external' }`. Supported
    values are:

    -   `internal`: use TinyCC, which is statically linked into the runtime.
        Never touches the filesystem and works even in sandboxed processes. The
        generated code is however not optimized, as TinyCC optimizes for small
        compiler footprint and short compilation times.
    -   `external`: use toolchain provided by the target system, assuming it is
        accessible to the process we're executing inside.
    -   `any`: same as `internal` if [`Process.arch`](#process-arch) is
        supported by TinyCC, and `external` otherwise. This is the default
        behavior if left unspecified.

-   `dispose()`: eagerly unmaps the module from memory. Useful for short-lived
    modules when waiting for a future garbage collection isn't desirable.

+   `builtins`: an object specifying builtins present when constructing a
    CModule from C source code. This is typically used by a scaffolding tool
    such as `frida-create` in order to set up a build environment that matches
    what CModule uses. The exact contents depends on the
    [`Process.arch`](#process-arch) and Frida version, but may look something
    like the following:

        {
          defines: {
            'GLIB_SIZEOF_VOID_P': '8',
            'G_GINT16_MODIFIER': '"h"',
            'G_GINT32_MODIFIER': '""',
            'G_GINT64_MODIFIER': '"ll"',
            'G_GSIZE_MODIFIER': '"l"',
            'G_GSSIZE_MODIFIER': '"l"',
            'HAVE_I386': true
          },
          headers: {
            'gum/arch-x86/gumx86writer.h': '…',
            'gum/gumdefs.h': '…',
            'gum/guminterceptor.h': '…',
            'gum/gummemory.h': '…',
            'gum/gummetalarray.h': '…',
            'gum/gummetalhash.h': '…',
            'gum/gummodulemap.h': '…',
            'gum/gumprocess.h': '…',
            'gum/gumspinlock.h': '…',
            'gum/gumstalker.h': '…',
            'glib.h': '…',
            'json-glib/json-glib.h': '…',
            'capstone.h': '…'
          }
        }

#### Examples

{% highlight js %}
const cm = new CModule(`
#include <stdio.h>

void hello(void) {
  printf("Hello World from CModule\\n");
}
`);

console.log(JSON.stringify(cm));

const hello = new NativeFunction(cm.hello, 'void', []);
hello();
{% endhighlight %}

Which you might load using Frida's REPL:

{% highlight sh %}
$ frida -p 0 -l example.js
{% endhighlight %}

(The REPL monitors the file on disk and reloads the script on change.)

You can then type `hello()` in the REPL to call the C function.

For prototyping we recommend using the Frida REPL's built-in CModule support:

{% highlight sh %}
$ frida -p 0 -C example.c
{% endhighlight %}

You may also add `-l example.js` to load some JavaScript next to it.
The JavaScript code may use the global variable named `cm` to access
the CModule object, but only after [`rpc.exports.init()`](#rpc-exports) has been
called, so perform any initialization depending on the CModule there. You may
also inject symbols by assigning to the global object named `cs`, but this
must be done *before* [`rpc.exports.init()`](#rpc-exports) gets called.

Here's an example:

![CModule REPL example](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EEyxQzwXoAAqoAw?format=jpg&name=small)

More details on CModule can be found in the **[Frida 12.7 release notes]({{
site.baseurl_root }}/news/2019/09/18/frida-12-7-released/)**.


### ApiResolver

+   `new ApiResolver(type)`: create a new resolver of the given `type`, allowing
    you to quickly find functions by name, with globs permitted. Precisely which
    resolvers are available depends on the current platform and runtimes loaded
    in the current process. As of the time of writing, the available resolvers
    are:

    -   `module`: Resolves exported and imported functions of shared libraries
                  currently loaded. Always available.
    -   `objc`: Resolves Objective-C methods of classes currently loaded.
                Available on macOS and iOS in processes that have the Objective-C
                runtime loaded. Use [`ObjC.available`](#objc-available) to check at
                runtime, or wrap your `new ApiResolver('objc')` call in a *try-catch*.

    The resolver will load the minimum amount of data required on creation, and
    lazy-load the rest depending on the queries it receives. It is thus
    recommended to use the same instance for a batch of queries, but recreate it
    for future batches to avoid looking at stale data.

-   `enumerateMatches(query)`: performs the resolver-specific `query` string,
    optionally suffixed with `/i` to perform case-insensitive matching,
    returning an array of objects containing the following properties:

    -   `name`: name of the API that was found
    -   `address`: address as a [`NativePointer`](#nativepointer)

{% highlight js %}
const resolver = new ApiResolver('module');
const matches = resolver.enumerateMatches('exports:*!open*');
const first = matches[0];
/*
 * Where `first` is an object similar to:
 *
 * {
 *   name: '/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib!opendir$INODE64',
 *   address: ptr('0x7fff870135c9')
 * }
 */
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight js %}
const resolver = new ApiResolver('objc');
const matches = resolver.enumerateMatches('-[NSURL* *HTTP*]');
const first = matches[0];
/*
 * Where `first` contains an object like this one:
 *
 * {
 *   name: '-[NSURLRequest valueForHTTPHeaderField:]',
 *   address: ptr('0x7fff94183e22')
 * }
 */
{% endhighlight %}


### DebugSymbol

+   `DebugSymbol.fromAddress(address)`, `DebugSymbol.fromName(name)`:
    look up debug information for `address`/`name` and return it as an object
    containing:

    -   `address`: Address that this symbol is for, as a [`NativePointer`](#nativepointer).
    -   `name`: Name of the symbol, as a string, or null if unknown.
    -   `moduleName`: Module name owning this symbol, as a string, or null if
                      unknown.
    -   `fileName`: File name owning this symbol, as a string, or null if
                    unknown.
    -   `lineNumber`: Line number in `fileName`, as a number, or null if
                      unknown.

    You may also call `toString()` on it, which is very useful when combined
    with [`Thread.backtrace()`](#thread-backtrace):

{% highlight js %}
const f = Module.getExportByName('libcommonCrypto.dylib',
    'CCCryptorCreate');
Interceptor.attach(f, {
  onEnter(args) {
    console.log('CCCryptorCreate called from:\n' +
        Thread.backtrace(this.context, Backtracer.ACCURATE)
        .map(DebugSymbol.fromAddress).join('\n') + '\n');
  }
});
{% endhighlight %}

+   `DebugSymbol.getFunctionByName(name)`: resolves a function name and
    returns its address as a [`NativePointer`](#nativepointer). Returns the first if
    more than one function is found. Throws an exception if the name cannot be
    resolved.

+   `DebugSymbol.findFunctionsNamed(name)`: resolves a function name and returns
    its addresses as an array of [`NativePointer`](#nativepointer) objects.

+   `DebugSymbol.findFunctionsMatching(glob)`: resolves function names matching
    `glob` and returns their addresses as an array of [`NativePointer`](#nativepointer)
    objects.

+   `DebugSymbol.load(path)`: loads debug symbols for a specific module.


### Kernel

+   `Kernel.available`: a boolean specifying whether the Kernel API is
    available. Do not invoke any other `Kernel` properties or methods unless
    this is the case.

+   `Kernel.base`: base address of the kernel, as a **[UInt64](#uint64)**.

+   `Kernel.pageSize`: size of a kernel page in bytes, as a number.

+   `Kernel.enumerateModules()`: enumerates kernel modules loaded right now,
    returning an array of objects containing the following properties:

    -   `name`: canonical module name as a string
    -   `base`: base address as a [`NativePointer`](#nativepointer)
    -   `size`: size in bytes

+   `Kernel.enumerateRanges(protection|specifier)`: enumerate kernel memory
    ranges satisfying `protection` given as a string of the form: `rwx`, where
    `rw-` means "must be at least readable and writable". Alternatively you may
    provide a `specifier` object with a `protection` key whose value is as
    aforementioned, and a `coalesce` key set to `true` if you'd like neighboring
    ranges with the same protection to be coalesced (the default is `false`;
    i.e. keeping the ranges separate). Returns an array of objects containing
    the following properties:
    {: #kernel-enumerateranges}

    -   `base`: base address as a [`NativePointer`](#nativepointer)
    -   `size`: size in bytes
    -   `protection`: protection string (see above)

+   `Kernel.enumerateModuleRanges(name, protection)`: just like
    [`Kernel.enumerateRanges`](#kernel-enumerateranges), except it's scoped to the
    specified module `name` – which may be `null` for the module of the kernel
    itself. Each range also has a `name` field containing a unique identifier as a
    string.

+   `Kernel.alloc(size)`: allocate `size` bytes of kernel memory, rounded up to
    a multiple of the kernel's page size. The returned value is a [`UInt64`](#uint64)
    specifying the base address of the allocation.

+   `Kernel.protect(address, size, protection)`: update protection on a region
    of kernel memory, where `protection` is a string of the same format as
    [`Kernel.enumerateRanges()`](#kernel-enumerateranges).

    For example:

{% highlight js %}
Kernel.protect(UInt64('0x1234'), 4096, 'rw-');
{% endhighlight %}

+   `Kernel.readByteArray(address, length)`: just like
    [`NativePointer#readByteArray`](#nativepointer-readbytearray), but reading from
    kernel memory.

+   `Kernel.writeByteArray(address, bytes)`: just like
    [`NativePointer#writeByteArray`](#nativepointer-writebytearray), but writing to
    kernel memory.

+   `Kernel.scan(address, size, pattern, callbacks)`: just like [`Memory.scan`](#memory-scan),
    but scanning kernel memory.
    {: #kernel-scan}

-   `Kernel.scanSync(address, size, pattern)`: synchronous version of [`scan()`](#kernel-scan)
    that returns the matches in an array.

    creating a signed pointer. This is a no-op if the current process does not support
    pointer authentication, returning this **[NativePointer](#nativepointer)** instead
    of a new value.
    {: #nativepointer-sign}

    Optionally, `key` may be specified as a string. Supported values are:
    -   ia: The IA key, for signing code pointers. This is the default.
    -   ib: The IB key, for signing code pointers.
    -   da: The DA key, for signing data pointers.
    -   db: The DB key, for signing data pointers.

    This is a no-op if the current process does not support pointer
    authentication, returning this **[NativePointer](#nativepointer)** instead of a
    new value.

    Optionally, `key` may be passed to specify which key was used to sign the
    pointer being stripped. Defaults to `ia`. (See [`sign()`](#nativepointer-sign)
    for supported values.)

-   `blend(smallInteger)`: makes a new **[NativePointer](#nativepointer)** by taking

    A JavaScript exception will be thrown if the address isn't writable.

-   `readS8()`, `readU8()`,
    `readS16()`, `readU16()`,
    `readS32()`, `readU32()`,
    `readShort()`, `readUShort()`,
    `readInt()`, `readUInt()`,
    `readFloat()`, `readDouble()`:
    reads a signed or unsigned 8/16/32/etc. or float/double value from
    this memory location and returns it as a number.

    A JavaScript exception will be thrown if the address isn't readable.

-   `writeS8(value)`, `writeU8(value)`,
    `writeS16(value)`, `writeU16(value)`,
    `writeS32(value)`, `writeU32(value)`,
    `writeShort(value)`, `writeUShort(value)`,
    `writeInt(value)`, `writeUInt(value)`,
    `writeFloat(value)`, `writeDouble(value)`:

    location.

    A JavaScript exception will be thrown if the address isn't writable.

-   `readByteArray(length)`: reads `length` bytes from this memory location, and
    returns it as an **[ArrayBuffer](#arraybuffer)**. This buffer may be efficiently
    transferred to your Frida-based application by passing it as the second argument
    to [`send()`](#communication-send).
    {: #nativepointer-readbytearray}

    A JavaScript exception will be thrown if any of the `length` bytes read from
    the address isn't readable.

-   `writeByteArray(bytes)`: writes `bytes` to this memory location, where
    `bytes` is either an **[ArrayBuffer](#arraybuffer)**, typically returned from
    `readByteArray()`, or an array of integers between 0 and 255. For example:
    `[ 0x13, 0x37, 0x42 ]`.
    {: #nativepointer-writebytearray}

    A JavaScript exception will be thrown if any of the bytes written to
    the address isn't writable.

-   `readCString([size = -1])`,
    `readUtf8String([size = -1])`,
    `readUtf16String([length = -1])`,
    `readAnsiString([size = -1])`:
    reads the bytes at this memory location as an ASCII, UTF-8, UTF-16, or ANSI
    string. Supply the optional `size` argument if you know the size of the
    string in bytes, or omit it or specify *-1* if the string is NUL-terminated.
    Likewise you may supply the optional `length` argument if you know the
    length of the string in characters.

    A JavaScript exception will be thrown if any of the `size` / `length` bytes
    read from the address isn't readable.

    Note that `readAnsiString()` is only available (and relevant) on Windows.

-   `writeUtf8String(str)`,
    `writeUtf16String(str)`,
    `writeAnsiString(str)`:
    encodes and writes the JavaScript string to this memory location (with
    NUL-terminator).

    A JavaScript exception will be thrown if any of the bytes written to
    the address isn't writable.

    Note that `writeAnsiString()` is only available (and relevant) on Windows.


### ArrayBuffer

+   `wrap(address, size)`: creates an ArrayBuffer backed by an existing memory
    region, where `address` is a [`NativePointer`](#nativepointer) specifying the
    base address of the region, and `size` is a number specifying its size. Unlike
    the [`NativePointer`](#nativepointer) read/write APIs, no validation is performed
    on access, meaning a bad pointer will crash the process.

-   `unwrap()`: returns a [`NativePointer`](#nativepointer) specifying the base
    address of the ArrayBuffer's backing store. It is the caller's responsibility to
    keep the buffer alive while the backing store is still being used.


### NativeFunction

+   `new NativeFunction(address, returnType, argTypes[, abi])`: create a new
    NativeFunction to call the function at `address` (specified with a
    [`NativePointer`](#nativepointer)), where `returnType` specifies the return type,
    and the `argTypes` array specifies the argument types. You may optionally also
    specify `abi` if not system default. For variadic functions, add a `'...'`
    entry to `argTypes` between the fixed arguments and the variadic ones.

    - #### Structs & Classes by Value

        As for structs or classes passed by value, instead of a string provide an
        array containing the struct's field types following each other. You may nest
        these as deep as desired for representing structs inside structs. Note that
        the returned object is also a [`NativePointer`](#nativepointer), and can thus
        be passed to [`Interceptor#attach`](#interceptor-attach).

        This must match the struct/class exactly, so if you have a struct with three
        ints, you must pass `['int', 'int', 'int']`.

        For a class that has virtual methods, the first field will be a pointer
        to **[the vtable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_method_table)**.

        For C++ scenarios involving a return value that is larger than
        [`Process.pointerSize`](#process-pointersize), a typical ABI may expect
        that a [`NativePointer`](#nativepointer) to preallocated space must be
        passed in as the first parameter. (This scenario is common in WebKit,
        for example.)

+   `new NativeFunction(address, returnType, argTypes[, options])`: just like
    the previous constructor, but where the fourth argument, `options`, is an
    object that may contain one or more of the following keys:

    -   `abi`: same enum as above.
    -   `scheduling`: scheduling behavior as a string. Supported values are:
        -   cooperative: Allow other threads to execute JavaScript code while
                         calling the native function, i.e. let go of the lock
                         before the call, and re-acquire it afterwards.
                         This is the default behavior.
        -   exclusive: Do not allow other threads to execute JavaScript code
                       while calling the native function, i.e. keep holding the
                       JavaScript lock.
                       This is faster but may result in deadlocks.
    -   `exceptions`: exception behavior as a string. Supported values are:
        -   steal: If the called function generates a native exception, e.g.
                   by dereferencing an invalid pointer, Frida will unwind the
                   stack and steal the exception, turning it into a JavaScript
                   exception that can be handled. This may leave the application
                   in an undefined state, but is useful to avoid crashing the
                   process while experimenting.
                   This is the default behavior.
        -   propagate: Let the application deal with any native exceptions that
                       occur during the function call. (Or, the handler
                       installed through [`Process.setExceptionHandler()`](#process-setexceptionhandler).)
    -   `traps`: code traps to be enabled, as a string. Supported values are:
        -   default: **[Interceptor.attach()](#interceptor-attach)** callbacks will be
                     called if any hooks are triggered by a function call.
        -   all: In addition to **[Interceptor](#interceptor)** callbacks, **[Stalker](#stalker)**
                 may also be temporarily reactivated for the duration of each function
                 call. This is useful for e.g. measuring code coverage while guiding a
                 fuzzer, implementing "step into" in a debugger, etc.
                 Note that this is also possible when using the **[Java](#java)**
                 and **[ObjC](#objc)** APIs, as method wrappers also provide a
                 `clone(options)` API to create a new method wrapper with custom
                 NativeFunction options.


### NativeCallback

+   `new NativeCallback(func, returnType, argTypes[, abi])`: create a new
    NativeCallback implemented by the JavaScript function `func`, where
    `returnType` specifies the return type, and the `argTypes` array specifies
    the argument types. You may also specify the abi if not system default.
    See [`NativeFunction`](#nativefunction) for details about supported types and
    abis. Note that the returned object is also a [`NativePointer`](#nativepointer),
    and can thus be passed to [`Interceptor#replace`](#interceptor-replace).
    When using the resulting callback with **[Interceptor.replace()](#interceptor-replace)**,
    `func` will be invoked with `this` bound to an object with some useful properties,
    just like the one in **[Interceptor.attach()](#interceptor-attach)**.


### SystemFunction

+   `new SystemFunction(address, returnType, argTypes[, abi])`: just like
    [`NativeFunction`](#nativefunction), but also provides a snapshot of the thread's
    last error status. The return value is an object wrapping the actual return value
    as `value`, with one additional platform-specific field named either `errno`
    (UNIX) or `lastError` (Windows).

+   `new SystemFunction(address, returnType, argTypes[, options])`: same as
    above but accepting an `options` object like [`NativeFunction`](#nativefunction)'s
    corresponding constructor.

---

## Network


### Socket

+   `Socket.listen([options])`: open a TCP or UNIX listening socket. Returns a
    *Promise* that receives a **[SocketListener](#socketlistener)**.

    Defaults to listening on both IPv4 and IPv6, if supported, and binding on
    all interfaces on a randomly selected TCP port.

    The optional `options` argument is an object that may contain some of the
    following keys:

    -   `family`: address family as a string. Supported values are:
        -   unix
        -   ipv4
        -   ipv6
        Defaults to listening on both `ipv4` and `ipv6` if supported.
    -   `host`: (IP family) IP address as a string. Defaults to all interfaces.
    -   `port`: (IP family) IP port as a number. Defaults to any available.
    -   `type`: (UNIX family) UNIX socket type as a string. Supported types are:
        -   anonymous
        -   path
        -   abstract
        -   abstract-padded
        Defaults to `path`.
    -   `path`: (UNIX family) UNIX socket path as a string.
    -   `backlog`: Listen backlog as a number. Defaults to `10`.

+   `Socket.connect(options)`: connect to a TCP or UNIX server. Returns a
    *Promise* that receives a **[SocketConnection](#socketconnection)**.

    The `options` argument is an object that should contain some of the
    following keys:

    -   `family`: address family as a string. Supported values are:
        -   unix
        -   ipv4
        -   ipv6
        Defaults to an IP family depending on the `host` specified.
    -   `host`: (IP family) IP address as a string. Defaults to `localhost`.
    -   `port`: (IP family) IP port as a number.
    -   `type`: (UNIX family) UNIX socket type as a string. Supported types are:
        -   anonymous
        -   path
        -   abstract
        -   abstract-padded
        Defaults to `path`.
    -   `path`: (UNIX family) UNIX socket path as a string.

+   `Socket.type(handle)`: inspect the OS socket `handle` and return its type
    as a string which is either `tcp`, `udp`, `tcp6`, `udp6`, `unix:stream`,
    `unix:dgram`, or `null` if invalid or unknown.

+   `Socket.localAddress(handle)`,
    `Socket.peerAddress(handle)`:
    inspect the OS socket `handle` and return its local or peer address, or
    `null` if invalid or unknown.

    The object returned has the fields:

    -   `ip`: (IP sockets) IP address as a string.
    -   `port`: (IP sockets) IP port as a number.
    -   `path`: (UNIX sockets) UNIX path as a string.


### SocketListener

All methods are fully asynchronous and return Promise objects.<br/><br/>

-   `path`: (UNIX family) path being listened on.

-   `port`: (IP family) IP port being listened on.

-   `close()`: close the listener, releasing resources related to it. Once the
    listener is closed, all other operations will fail. Closing a listener
    multiple times is allowed and will not result in an error.

-   `accept()`: wait for the next client to connect. The returned *Promise*
    receives a **[SocketConnection](#socketconnection)**.


### SocketConnection

Inherits from **[IOStream](#iostream)**.
All methods are fully asynchronous and return Promise objects.<br/><br/>

-   `setNoDelay(noDelay)`: disable the Nagle algorithm if `noDelay` is `true`,
    otherwise enable it. The Nagle algorithm is enabled by default, so it is
    only necessary to call this method if you wish to optimize for low delay
    instead of high throughput.

---

## File and Stream


### File

+   `new File(filePath, mode)`: open or create the file at `filePath` with
    the `mode` string specifying how it should be opened. For example `"wb"`
    to open the file for writing in binary mode (this is the same format as
    `fopen()` from the C standard library).

-   `write(data)`: synchronously write `data` to the file, where `data` is
    either a string or a buffer as returned by [`NativePointer#readByteArray`](#nativepointer-readbytearray)

-   `flush()`: flush any buffered data to the underlying file

-   `close()`: close the file. You should call this function when you're done
    with the file unless you are fine with this happening when the object is
    garbage-collected or the script is unloaded.


### IOStream

All methods are fully asynchronous and return Promise objects.<br/><br/>

-   `input`: the **[InputStream](#inputstream)** to read from.

-   `output`: the **[OutputStream](#outputstream)** to write to.

-   `close()`: close the stream, releasing resources related to it. This will
    also close the individual input and output streams. Once the stream is
    closed, all other operations will fail. Closing a stream multiple times is
    allowed and will not result in an error.


### InputStream

All methods are fully asynchronous and return Promise objects.<br/><br/>

-   `close()`: close the stream, releasing resources related to it. Once the
    stream is closed, all other operations will fail. Closing a stream multiple
    times is allowed and will not result in an error.

-   `read(size)`: read up to `size` bytes from the stream. The returned
    **Promise** receives an **[ArrayBuffer](#arraybuffer)** up to `size` bytes long.
    End of stream is signalled through an empty buffer.

-   `readAll(size)`: keep reading from the stream until exactly `size` bytes
    have been consumed. The returned *Promise* receives an **[ArrayBuffer](#arraybuffer)**
    that is exactly `size` bytes long. Premature error or end of stream results in the
    *Promise* getting rejected with an error, where the `Error` object has a
    `partialData` property containing the incomplete data.


### OutputStream

All methods are fully asynchronous and return Promise objects.<br/><br/>

-   `close()`: close the stream, releasing resources related to it. Once the
    stream is closed, all other operations will fail. Closing a stream multiple
    times is allowed and will not result in an error.

-   `write(data)`: try to write `data` to the stream. The `data` value is either
    an **[ArrayBuffer](#arraybuffer)** or an array of integers between 0 and 255. The
    returned *Promise* receives a *Number* specifying how many bytes of `data` were
    written to the stream.

-   `writeAll(data)`: keep writing to the stream until all of `data` has been
    written. The `data` value is either an **[ArrayBuffer](#arraybuffer)** or an array
    of integers between 0 and 255. Premature error or end of stream results in an
    error, where the `Error` object has a `partialSize` property specifying how many
    bytes of `data` were written to the stream before the error occurred.

-   `writeMemoryRegion(address, size)`: try to write `size` bytes to the stream,
    reading them from `address`, which is a [`NativePointer`](#nativepointer). The
    returned *Promise* receives a *Number* specifying how many bytes of `data` were
    written to the stream.


### UnixInputStream

(Only available on UNIX-like OSes.)<br/><br/>

+   `new UnixInputStream(fd[, options])`: create a new
    **[InputStream](#inputstream)** from the specified file descriptor `fd`.

    You may also supply an `options` object with `autoClose` set to `true` to
    make the stream close the underlying file descriptor when the stream is
    released, either through `close()` or future garbage-collection.


### UnixOutputStream

(Only available on UNIX-like OSes.)<br/><br/>

+   `new UnixOutputStream(fd[, options])`: create a new
    **[OutputStream](#outputstream)** from the specified file descriptor `fd`.

    You may also supply an `options` object with `autoClose` set to `true` to
    make the stream close the underlying file descriptor when the stream is
    released, either through `close()` or future garbage-collection.


### Win32InputStream

(Only available on Windows.)<br/><br/>

+   `new Win32InputStream(handle[, options])`: create a new
    **[InputStream](#inputstream)** from the specified `handle`, which is a Windows
    *HANDLE* value.

    You may also supply an `options` object with `autoClose` set to `true` to
    make the stream close the underlying handle when the stream is released,
    either through `close()` or future garbage-collection.


### Win32OutputStream

(Only available on Windows.)<br/><br/>

+   `new Win32OutputStream(handle[, options])`: create a new
    **[OutputStream](#outputstream)** from the specified `handle`, which is a
    Windows *HANDLE* value.

    You may also supply an `options` object with `autoClose` set to `true` to
    make the stream close the underlying handle when the stream is released,
    either through `close()` or future garbage-collection.


## Database


### SqliteDatabase

+   `SqliteDatabase.open(path[, options])`: opens the SQLite v3 database
    specified by `path`, a string containing the filesystem path to the
    database. By default the database will be opened read-write, but you may
    customize this behavior by providing an `options` object with a property
    named `flags`, specifying an array of strings containing one or more of the
    following values: `readonly`, `readwrite`, `create`.  The returned
    SqliteDatabase object will allow you to perform queries on the database.

+   `SqliteDatabase.openInline(encodedContents)`: just like `open()` but the
    contents of the database is provided as a string containing its data,
    Base64-encoded. We recommend gzipping the database before Base64-encoding
    it, but this is optional and detected by looking for a gzip magic marker.
    The database is opened read-write, but is 100% in-memory and never touches
    the filesystem. This is useful for agents that need to bundle a cache of
    precomputed data, e.g. static analysis data used to guide dynamic analysis.
    {: #sqlitedatabase-openinline}

-   `close()`: close the database. You should call this function when you're
    done with the database, unless you are fine with this happening when the
    object is garbage-collected or the script is unloaded.

-   `exec(sql)`: execute a raw SQL query, where `sql` is a string containing
    the text-representation of the query. The query's result is ignored, so this
    should only be used for queries for setting up the database, e.g. table
    creation.

-   `prepare(sql)`: compile the provided SQL into a
    **[SqliteStatement](#sqlitestatement)** object, where `sql` is a string
    containing the text-representation of the query.

    For example:

{% highlight js %}
const db = SqliteDatabase.open('/path/to/people.db');

const smt = db.prepare('SELECT name, bio FROM people WHERE age = ?');

console.log('People whose age is 42:');
smt.bindInteger(1, 42);
let row;
while ((row = smt.step()) !== null) {
  const [name, bio] = row;
  console.log('Name:', name);
  console.log('Bio:', bio);
}
smt.reset();
{% endhighlight %}

-   `dump()`: dump the database to a gzip-compressed blob encoded as Base64,
    where the result is returned as a string. This is useful for inlining a
    cache in your agent's code, loaded by calling [`SqliteDatabase.openInline()`](#sqlitedatabase-openinline).


### SqliteStatement

-   `bindInteger(index, value)`: bind the integer `value` to `index`
-   `bindFloat(index, value)`: bind the floating point `value` to `index`
-   `bindText(index, value)`: bind the text `value` to `index`
-   `bindBlob(index, bytes)`: bind the blob `bytes` to `index`, where `bytes`
    is an **[ArrayBuffer](#arraybuffer)**, array of byte values, or a string
-   `bindNull(index)`: bind a null value to `index`
-   `step()`: either start a new query and get the first result, or move to the
    next one. Returns an array containing the values in the order specified by
    the query, or `null` when the last result is reached. You should call
    `reset()` at that point if you intend to use this object again.
-   `reset()`: reset internal state to allow subsequent queries

---

## Instrumentation


### Interceptor

+   `Interceptor.attach(target, callbacks[, data])`: intercept calls to function
    at `target`. This is a [`NativePointer`](#nativepointer) specifying the address
    of the function you would like to intercept calls to. Note that on 32-bit ARM this
    address must have its least significant bit set to 0 for ARM functions, and
    1 for Thumb functions. Frida takes care of this detail for you if you get
    the address from a Frida API (for example [`Module.getExportByName()`](#module-getexportbyname)).
    {: #interceptor-attach}

    The `callbacks` argument is an object containing one or more of:

    -   `onEnter(args)`: callback function given one argument `args` that can be
        used to read or write arguments as an array of
        [`NativePointer`](#nativepointer) objects. {: #interceptor-onenter}

    -   `onLeave(retval)`: callback function given one argument `retval` that is
        a [`NativePointer`](#nativepointer)-derived object containing the raw
        return value.
        You may call `retval.replace(1337)` to replace the return value with
        the integer `1337`, or `retval.replace(ptr("0x1234"))` to replace with
        a pointer.
        Note that this object is recycled across *onLeave* calls, so do not
        store and use it outside your callback. Make a deep copy if you need
        to store the contained value, e.g.: `ptr(retval.toString())`.
        {: #interceptor-onleave}

    In case the hooked function is very hot, `onEnter` and `onLeave` may be
    [`NativePointer`](#nativepointer) values pointing at native C functions compiled
    using **[CModule](#cmodule)**. Their signatures are:

    -   `void onEnter (GumInvocationContext * ic)`

    -   `void onLeave (GumInvocationContext * ic)`

    In such cases, the third optional argument `data` may be a [`NativePointer`](#nativepointer)
    accessible through `gum_invocation_context_get_listener_function_data()`.

    You may also intercept arbitrary instructions by passing a function instead
    of the `callbacks` object. This function has the same signature as
    `onEnter`, but the `args` argument passed to it will only give you sensible
    values if the intercepted instruction is at the beginning of a function or
    at a point where registers/stack have not yet deviated from that point.

    Just like above, this function may also be implemented in C by specifying
    a [`NativePointer`](#nativepointer) instead of a function.

    Returns a listener object that you can call `detach()` on.

    Note that these functions will be invoked with `this` bound to a
    per-invocation (thread-local) object where you can store arbitrary data,
    which is useful if you want to read an argument in `onEnter` and act on it
    in `onLeave`.

    For example:

{% highlight js %}
Interceptor.attach(Module.getExportByName('libc.so', 'read'), {
  onEnter(args) {
    this.fileDescriptor = args[0].toInt32();
  },
  onLeave(retval) {
    if (retval.toInt32() > 0) {
      /* do something with this.fileDescriptor */
    }
  }
});
{% endhighlight %}

+   Additionally, the object contains some useful properties:

    -   `returnAddress`: return address as a **[NativePointer](#nativepointer)**

    -   `context`: object with the keys `pc` and `sp`, which are
        **[NativePointer](#nativepointer)** objects specifying EIP/RIP/PC and
        ESP/RSP/SP, respectively, for ia32/x64/arm. Other processor-specific keys
        are also available, e.g. `eax`, `rax`, `r0`, `x0`, etc.
        You may also update register values by assigning to these keys.

    -   `errno`: (UNIX) current errno value (you may replace it)

    -   `lastError`: (Windows) current OS error value (you may replace it)

    -   `threadId`: OS thread ID

    -   `depth`: call depth of relative to other invocations

    For example:

{% highlight js %}
Interceptor.attach(Module.getExportByName(null, 'read'), {
  onEnter(args) {
    console.log('Context information:');
    console.log('Context  : ' + JSON.stringify(this.context));
    console.log('Return   : ' + this.returnAddress);
    console.log('ThreadId : ' + this.threadId);
    console.log('Depth    : ' + this.depth);
    console.log('Errornr  : ' + this.err);

    // Save arguments for processing in onLeave.
    this.fd = args[0].toInt32();
    this.buf = args[1];
    this.count = args[2].toInt32();
  },
  onLeave(result) {
    console.log('----------')
    // Show argument 1 (buf), saved during onEnter.
    const numBytes = result.toInt32();
    if (numBytes > 0) {
      console.log(hexdump(this.buf, { length: numBytes, ansi: true }));
    }
    console.log('Result   : ' + numBytes);
  }
})
{% endhighlight %}

<div class="note">
  <h5>Performance considerations</h5>
  <p>
    The callbacks provided have a significant impact on performance. If you only
    need to inspect arguments but do not care about the return value, or the
    other way around, make sure you omit the callback that you don't need; i.e.
    avoid putting your logic in <i>onEnter</i> and leaving <i>onLeave</i> in
    there as an empty callback.
  </p>
  <p>
    On an iPhone 5S the base overhead when providing just <i>onEnter</i> might be
    something like 6 microseconds, and 11 microseconds with both <i>onEnter</i>
    and <i>onLeave</i> provided.
  </p>
  <p markdown="1">
    Also be careful about intercepting calls to functions that are called a
    bazillion times per second; while **[send()](#communication-send)** is
    asynchronous, the total overhead of sending a single message is not optimized for
    high frequencies, so that means Frida leaves it up to you to batch multiple values
    into a single **[send()](#communication-send)**-call, based on whether low delay
    or high throughput is desired.
  </p>
  <p markdown="1">
    However when hooking hot functions you may use Interceptor in conjunction
    with **[CModule](#cmodule)** to implement the callbacks in C.
  </p>
</div>

+   `Interceptor.detachAll()`: detach all previously attached callbacks.

+   `Interceptor.replace(target, replacement[, data])`: replace function at
    `target` with implementation at `replacement`. This is typically used if you
    want to fully or partially replace an existing function's implementation.
    {: #interceptor-replace}

    Use [`NativeCallback`](#nativecallback) to implement a `replacement` in JavaScript.

    In case the replaced function is very hot, you may implement `replacement`
    in C using **[CModule](#cmodule)**. You may then also specify the third optional
    argument `data`, which is a [`NativePointer`](#nativepointer) accessible through
    `gum_invocation_context_get_listener_function_data()`. Use
    `gum_interceptor_get_current_invocation()` to get hold of the
    `GumInvocationContext *`.

    Note that `replacement` will be kept alive until [`Interceptor#revert`](#interceptor-revert) is
    called.

    If you want to chain to the original implementation you can synchronously
    call `target` through a [`NativeFunction`](#nativefunction) inside your
    implementation, which will bypass and go directly to the original implementation.

    Here's an example:

+   `Interceptor.revert(target)`: revert function at `target` to the previous
    implementation.
    {: #interceptor-revert}

+   `Interceptor.flush()`: ensure any pending changes have been committed
    to memory. This is should only be done in the few cases where this is
    necessary, e.g. if you just **[attach()](#interceptor-attach)**ed to or **[replace()](#interceptor-replace)**d a function that you
    are about to call using **[NativeFunction](#nativefunction)**. Pending changes
    are flushed automatically whenever the current thread is about to leave the
    JavaScript runtime or calls **[send()](#communication-send)**. This includes any
    API built on top of **[send()](#communication-send)**, like when returning from an
    **[RPC](#rpc-exports)** method, and calling any method on the **[console](#console)** API.


### Stalker

+   `Stalker.exclude(range)`: marks the specified memory `range` as excluded,
    which is an object with `base` and `size` properties – like the properties
    in an object returned by e.g. [`Process.getModuleByName()`](#process-getmodulebyname).

    This means Stalker will not follow execution when encountering a call to an
    instruction in such a range. You will thus be able to observe/modify the
    arguments going in, and the return value coming back, but won't see the
    instructions that happened between.

    Useful to improve performance and reduce noise.

+   `Stalker.follow([threadId, options])`: start stalking `threadId` (or the
    current thread if omitted), optionally with `options` for enabling events.
    {: #stalker-follow}

    For example:

{% highlight js %}
const mainThread = Process.enumerateThreads()[0];

Stalker.follow(mainThread.id, {
  events: {
    call: true, // CALL instructions: yes please

    // Other events:
    ret: false, // RET instructions
    exec: false, // all instructions: not recommended as it's
                 //                   a lot of data
    block: false, // block executed: coarse execution trace
    compile: false // block compiled: useful for coverage
  },

  //
  // Only specify one of the two following callbacks.
  // (See note below.)
  //

  //
  // onReceive: Called with `events` containing a binary blob
  //            comprised of one or more GumEvent structs.
  //            See `gumevent.h` for details about the
  //            format. Use `Stalker.parse()` to examine the
  //            data.
  //
  //onReceive(events) {
  //},
  //

  //
  // onCallSummary: Called with `summary` being a key-value
  //                mapping of call target to number of
  //                calls, in the current time window. You
  //                would typically implement this instead of
  //                `onReceive()` for efficiency, i.e. when
  //                you only want to know which targets were
  //                called and how many times, but don't care
  //                about the order that the calls happened
  //                in.
  //
  onCallSummary(summary) {
  },

  //
  // Advanced users: This is how you can plug in your own
  //                 StalkerTransformer, where the provided
  //                 function is called synchronously
  //                 whenever Stalker wants to recompile
  //                 a basic block of the code that's about
  //                 to be executed by the stalked thread.
  //
  //transform(iterator) {
  //  let instruction = iterator.next();
  //
  //  const startAddress = instruction.address;
  //  const isAppCode = startAddress.compare(appStart) >= 0 &&
  //      startAddress.compare(appEnd) === -1;
  //
  //  do {
  //    if (isAppCode && instruction.mnemonic === 'ret') {
  //      iterator.putCmpRegI32('eax', 60);
  //      iterator.putJccShortLabel('jb', 'nope', 'no-hint');
  //
  //      iterator.putCmpRegI32('eax', 90);
  //      iterator.putJccShortLabel('ja', 'nope', 'no-hint');
  //
  //      iterator.putCallout(onMatch);
  //
  //      iterator.putLabel('nope');
  //    }
  //
  //    iterator.keep();
  //  } while ((instruction = iterator.next()) !== null);
  //},
  //
  // The default implementation is just:
  //
  //   while (iterator.next() !== null)
  //     iterator.keep();
  //
  // The example above shows how you can insert your own code
  // just before every `ret` instruction across any code
  // executed by the stalked thread inside the app's own
  // memory range. It inserts code that checks if the `eax`
  // register contains a value between 60 and 90, and inserts
  // a synchronous callout back into JavaScript whenever that
  // is the case. The callback receives a single argument
  // that gives it access to the CPU registers, and it is
  // also able to modify them.
  //
  // function onMatch (context) {
  //   console.log('Match! pc=' + context.pc +
  //       ' rax=' + context.rax.toInt32());
  // }
  //
  // Note that not calling keep() will result in the
  // instruction getting dropped, which makes it possible
  // for your transform to fully replace certain instructions
  // when this is desirable.
  //

  //
  // Want better performance? Write the callbacks in C:
  //
  // /*
  //  * const cm = new CModule(\`
  //  *
  //  * #include <gum/gumstalker.h>
  //  *

<div class="note">
  <h5>Performance considerations</h5>
  <p>
    The callbacks provided have a significant impact on performance. If you only
    need periodic call summaries but do not care about the raw events, or the
    other way around, make sure you omit the callback that you don't need; i.e.
    avoid putting your logic in <i>onCallSummary</i> and leaving
    <i>onReceive</i> in there as an empty callback.
  </p>
  <p markdown="1">
    Also note that Stalker may be used in conjunction with **[CModule](#cmodule)**,
    which means the callbacks may be implemented in C.
  </p>
</div>

+   `Stalker.unfollow([threadId])`: stop stalking `threadId` (or the current
    thread if omitted).
    {: #stalker-unfollow}

+   `Stalker.parse(events[, options])`: parse GumEvent binary blob, optionally
    with `options` for customizing the output.

    For example:

{% highlight js %}
  onReceive(events) {
    console.log(Stalker.parse(events, {
      annotate: true, // to display the type of event
      stringify: true
        // to format pointer values as strings instead of `NativePointer`
        // values, i.e. less overhead if you're just going to `send()` the
        // thing not actually parse the data agent-side
    }));
  },
{% endhighlight %}

+   `Stalker.flush()`: flush out any buffered events. Useful when you don't want
    to wait until the next [`Stalker.queueDrainInterval`](#stalker-queuedraininterval) tick.
    {: #stalker-flush}

+   `Stalker.garbageCollect()`: free accumulated memory at a safe point after
    [`Stalker#unfollow`](#stalker-unfollow). This is needed to avoid race-conditions
    where the thread just unfollowed is executing its last instructions.

+   `Stalker.invalidate(address)`: invalidates the current thread's translated
    code for a given basic block. Useful when providing a transform callback and
    wanting to dynamically adapt the instrumentation for a given basic block.
    This is much more efficient than unfollowing and re-following the thread,
    which would discard all cached translations and require all encountered
    basic blocks to be compiled from scratch.

+   `Stalker.invalidate(threadId, address)`: invalidates a specific thread's
    translated code for a given basic block. Useful when providing a transform
    callback and wanting to dynamically adapt the instrumentation for a given
    basic block. This is much more efficient than unfollowing and re-following
    the thread, which would discard all cached translations and require all
    encountered basic blocks to be compiled from scratch.

+   `Stalker.addCallProbe(address, callback[, data])`: call `callback` (see
    [`Interceptor#attach#onEnter`](#interceptor-attach) for signature) synchronously
    when a call is made to `address`. Returns an id that can be passed to
    [`Stalker#removeCallProbe`](#stalker-removecallprobe) later.
    {: #stalker-addcallprobe}

    It is also possible to implement `callback` in C using **[CModule](#cmodule)**,
    by specifying a [`NativePointer`](#nativepointer) instead of a function. Signature:

    -   `void onCall (GumCallSite * site, gpointer user_data)`

    In such cases, the third optional argument `data` may be a [`NativePointer`](#nativepointer)
    whose value is passed to the callback as `user_data`.

+   `Stalker.removeCallProbe`: remove a call probe added by
    [`Stalker#addCallProbe`](#stalker-addcallprobe).
    {: #stalker-removecallprobe}

+   `Stalker.trustThreshold`: an integer specifying how many times a piece of
    code needs to be executed before it is assumed it can be trusted to not
    mutate.
    Specify -1 for no trust (slow), 0 to trust code from the get-go, and N to
    trust code after it has been executed N times. Defaults to 1.

+   `Stalker.queueCapacity`: an integer specifying the capacity of the event
    queue in number of events. Defaults to 16384 events.

+   `Stalker.queueDrainInterval`: an integer specifying the time in milliseconds
    between each time the event queue is drained. Defaults to 250 ms, which
    means that the event queue is drained four times per second. You may also
    set this property to zero to disable periodic draining, and instead call
    [`Stalker.flush()`](#stalker-flush) when you would like the queue to be drained.
    {: #stalker-queuedraininterval}


### ObjC

+   `ObjC.available`: a boolean specifying whether the current process has an
    Objective-C runtime loaded. Do not invoke any other `ObjC` properties or
    methods unless this is the case.
    {: #objc-available}

+   `ObjC.api`: an object mapping function names to [`NativeFunction`](#nativefunction) instances
    for direct access to a big portion of the Objective-C runtime API.

+   `ObjC.classes`: an object mapping class names to [`ObjC.Object`](#objc-object)
    JavaScript bindings for each of the currently registered classes. You can interact
    with objects by using dot notation and replacing colons with underscores, i.e.:
    `[NSString stringWithString:@"Hello World"]`
    becomes
    `const { NSString } = ObjC.classes; NSString.stringWithString_("Hello World");`.
    Note the underscore after the method name. Refer to iOS Examples section for
    more details.
    {: #objc-classes}

+   `ObjC.protocols`: an object mapping protocol names to [`ObjC.Protocol`](#objc-protocol)
    JavaScript bindings for each of the currently registered protocols.

+   `ObjC.mainQueue`: the GCD queue of the main thread

+   `ObjC.schedule(queue, work)`: schedule the JavaScript function `work` on
    the GCD queue specified by `queue`. An `NSAutoreleasePool` is created just
    before calling `work`, and cleaned up on return.

{% highlight js %}
const { NSSound } = ObjC.classes; /* macOS */
ObjC.schedule(ObjC.mainQueue, function () {
    const sound = NSSound.alloc().initWithContentsOfFile_byReference_("/Users/oleavr/.Trash/test.mp3", true);
    sound.play();
});
{% endhighlight %}

+   <code id="objc-object">new ObjC.Object(handle[, protocol])</code>: create a JavaScript binding given
    the existing object at `handle` (a **[NativePointer](#nativepointer)**). You may
    also specify the `protocol` argument if you'd like to treat `handle` as an object
    implementing a certain protocol only.

{% highlight js %}
Interceptor.attach(myFunction.implementation, {
  onEnter(args) {
    // ObjC: args[0] = self, args[1] = selector, args[2-n] = arguments
    const myString = new ObjC.Object(args[2]);
    console.log("String argument: " + myString.toString());
  }
});
{% endhighlight %}

>   This object has some special properties:
>
>   -   `$kind`: string specifying either `instance`, `class` or `meta-class`
>   -   `$super`: an **[ObjC.Object](#objc-object)** instance used for chaining up to
>       super-class method implementations
>   -   `$superClass`: super-class as an **[ObjC.Object](#objc-object)** instance
>   -   `$class`: class of this object as an **[ObjC.Object](#objc-object)** instance
>   -   `$className`: string containing the class name of this object
>   -   `$moduleName`: string containing the module path of this object
>   -   `$protocols`: object mapping protocol name to [`ObjC.Protocol`](#objc-protocol)
>       instance for each of the protocols that this object conforms to
>   -   `$methods`: array containing native method names exposed by this object's
>       class and parent classes
>   -   `$ownMethods`: array containing native method names exposed by this object's
>       class, not including parent classes
>   -   `$ivars`: object mapping each instance variable name to its current
>       value, allowing you to read and write each through access and assignment
>
>   There is also an `equals(other)` method for checking whether two instances
>   refer to the same underlying object.

+   `new ObjC.Protocol(handle)`: create a JavaScript binding given the existing
    protocol at `handle` (a **[NativePointer](#nativepointer)**).
    {: #objc-protocol}

+   `new ObjC.Block(target[, options])`: create a JavaScript binding given the
    existing block at `target` (a **[NativePointer](#nativepointer)**), or, to define
    a new block, `target` should be an object specifying the type signature and
    JavaScript function to call whenever the block is invoked. The function is
    specified with an `implementation` key, and the signature is specified either
    through a `types` key, or through the `retType` and `argTypes` keys. See
    [`ObjC.registerClass()`](#objc-registerclass) for details.

    Note that if an existing block lacks signature metadata, you may call
    `declare(signature)`, where `signature` is an object with either a `types`
    key, or `retType` and `argTypes` keys, as described above.

    You may also provide an `options` object with the same options as supported
    by **[NativeFunction](#nativefunction)**, e.g. to pass `traps: 'all'` in order
    to [`Stalker.follow()`](#stalker-follow) the execution when calling the block.

    The most common use-case is hooking an existing block, which for a block
    expecting two arguments would look something like:

{% highlight js %}
const pendingBlocks = new Set();

Interceptor.attach(..., {
  onEnter(args) {
    const block = new ObjC.Block(args[4]);
    pendingBlocks.add(block); // Keep it alive
    const appCallback = block.implementation;
    block.implementation = (error, value) => {
      // Do your logging here
      const result = appCallback(error, value);
      pendingBlocks.delete(block);
      return result;
    };
  }
});
{% endhighlight %}

+   `ObjC.implement(method, fn)`: create a JavaScript implementation compatible
    with the signature of `method`, where the JavaScript function `fn` is used
    as the implementation. Returns a [`NativeCallback`](#nativecallback) that you may
    assign to an ObjC method's `implementation` property.

{% highlight js %}
const NSSound = ObjC.classes.NSSound; /* macOS */
const oldImpl = NSSound.play.implementation;
NSSound.play.implementation = ObjC.implement(NSSound.play, (handle, selector) => {
  return oldImpl(handle, selector);
});

const NSView = ObjC.classes.NSView; /* macOS */
const drawRect = NSView['- drawRect:'];
const oldImpl = drawRect.implementation;
drawRect.implementation = ObjC.implement(drawRect, (handle, selector) => {
  oldImpl(handle, selector);
});
{% endhighlight %}

>   As the `implementation` property is a [`NativeFunction`](#nativefunction) and thus also a
>   [`NativePointer`](#nativepointer), you may also use [`Interceptor`](#interceptor) to hook functions:

{% highlight js %}
const { NSSound } = ObjC.classes; /* macOS */
Interceptor.attach(NSSound.play.implementation, {
  onEnter() {
    send("[NSSound play]");
  }
});
{% endhighlight %}

+   `ObjC.registerProxy(properties)`: create a new class designed to act as a
    proxy for a target object, where `properties` is an object specifying:

    -   `protocols`: (optional) Array of protocols this class conforms to.
    -   `methods`: (optional) Object specifying methods to implement.
    -   `events`: (optional) Object specifying callbacks for getting notified
        about events:
        -   `dealloc()`: Called right after the object has been deallocated.
            This is where you might clean up any associated state.
        -   `forward(name)`: Called with `name` specifying the method name that
            we're about to forward a call to. This might be where you'd start
            out with a temporary callback that just logs the names to help you
            decide which methods to override.

        if you don't care about the globally visible name and would like the

+   `ObjC.bind(obj, data)`: bind some JavaScript data to an Objective-C
    instance; see [`ObjC.registerClass()`](#objc-registerclass) for an example.

+   `ObjC.unbind(obj)`: unbind previous associated JavaScript data from an
    Objective-C instance; see [`ObjC.registerClass()`](#objc-registerclass) for an example.

+   `ObjC.getBoundData(obj)`: look up previously bound data from an Objective-C
    object.

+   `ObjC.enumerateLoadedClasses([options, ]callbacks)`: enumerate classes
    loaded right now, where `callbacks` is an object specifying:
    {: #objc-enumerateloadedclasses}

    -   `onMatch(name, owner)`: called for each loaded class with the `name` of
        the class as a string, and `owner` specifying the path to the module
        where the class was loaded from. To obtain a JavaScript wrapper for a
        given class, do: [`ObjC.classes[name]`](#objc-classes).

    -   `onComplete()`: called when all classes have been enumerated.

    For example:

{% highlight js %}
ObjC.enumerateLoadedClasses({
  onMatch(name, owner) {
    console.log('onMatch:', name, owner);
  },
  onComplete() {
  }
});
{% endhighlight %}

The optional `options` argument is an object where you may specify the
`ownedBy` property to limit enumeration to modules in a given [`ModuleMap`](#modulemap).

For example:

{% highlight js %}
const appModules = new ModuleMap(isAppModule);
ObjC.enumerateLoadedClasses({ ownedBy: appModules }, {
  onMatch(name, owner) {
    console.log('onMatch:', name, owner);
  },
  onComplete() {

}
{% endhighlight %}

+   `ObjC.enumerateLoadedClassesSync([options])`: synchronous version of
    [`enumerateLoadedClasses()`](#objc-enumerateloadedclasses) that returns an object
    mapping owner module to an array of class names.

    For example:

{% highlight js %}
const appModules = new ModuleMap(isAppModule);
const appClasses = ObjC.enumerateLoadedClassesSync({ ownedBy: appModules });
console.log('appClasses:', JSON.stringify(appClasses));

function isAppModule(m) {

}
{% endhighlight %}

+   `ObjC.choose(specifier, callbacks)`: enumerate live instances of classes
    matching `specifier` by scanning the heap. `specifier` is either a class
    selector or an object specifying a class selector and desired options.
    The class selector is an **[ObjC.Object](#objc-object)** of a class, e.g.
    *ObjC.classes.UIButton*.
    When passing an object as the specifier you should provide the `class`
    field with your class selector, and the `subclasses` field with a
    boolean indicating whether you're also interested in subclasses matching the
    given class selector. The default is to also include subclasses.
    The `callbacks` argument is an object specifying:
    {: #objc-choose}

    -   `onMatch(instance)`: called once for each live instance found with a
        ready-to-use `instance` just as if you would have called
        [`new ObjC.Object(ptr("0x1234"))`](#objc-object) knowing that this
        particular Objective-C instance lives at *0x1234*.

        This function may return the string `stop` to cancel the enumeration
        early.

    -   `onComplete()`: called when all instances have been enumerated

+   `ObjC.chooseSync(specifier)`: synchronous version of [`choose()`](#objc-choose)
    that returns the instances in an array.

+   `ObjC.selector(name)`: convert the JavaScript string `name` to a selector

+   `ObjC.selectorAsString(sel)`: convert the selector `sel` to a JavaScript
    string

        may be passed to [`use()`](#java-use) to get a JavaScript wrapper.
        You may also [`Java.cast()`](#java-cast) the `handle` to `java.lang.Class`.

    -   `onComplete()`: called when all classes have been enumerated.

    in the Java VM, where `callbacks` is an object specifying:
    {: #java-enumerateclassloaders}

    -   `onMatch(loader)`: called for each class loader with `loader`, a wrapper
        for the specific `java.lang.ClassLoader`.

    -   `onComplete()`: called when all class loaders have been enumerated.

    You may pass such a loader to `Java.ClassFactory.get()` to be able to
    [`.use()`](#java-use) classes on the specified class loader.

+   `Java.enumerateClassLoadersSync()`: synchronous version of
    [`enumerateClassLoaders()`](#java-enumerateclassloaders) that returns the
    class loaders in an array.

+   `Java.enumerateMethods(query)`: enumerate methods matching `query`,
    specified as `"class!method"`, with globs permitted. May also be suffixed
    with `/` and one or more modifiers:

    -   `i`: Case-insensitive matching.
    -   `s`: Include method signatures, so e.g. `"putInt"` becomes
        `"putInt(java.lang.String, int): void"`.
    -   `u`: User-defined classes only, ignoring system classes.

     only deoptimizes boot image code. Use with
     `dalvik.vm.dex2oat-flags --inline-max-code-units=0` for best results.

+   `Java.vm`: object with the following methods:

        discovered through `Java.enumerateClassLoaders()` and interacted with
        through this API.

    -   `loader`: read-only property providing a wrapper for the class loader
        currently being used. For the default class factory this is updated by
        the first call to [`Java.perform()`](#java-perform).

    -   `cacheDir`: string containing path to cache directory currently being
        used. For the default class factory this is updated by the first call
        to [`Java.perform()`](#java-perform).

## CPU Instruction


### Instruction

+   `Instruction.parse(target)`: parse the instruction at the `target` address
    in memory, represented by a [`NativePointer`](#nativepointer).
    Note that on 32-bit ARM this address must have its least significant bit
    set to 0 for ARM functions, and 1 for Thumb functions. Frida takes care
    of this detail for you if you get the address from a Frida API (for
    example [`Module.getExportByName()`](#module-getexportbyname)).

    The object returned has the fields:

    -   `address`: address (EIP) of this instruction, as a [`NativePointer`](#nativepointer)
    -   `next`: pointer to the next instruction, so you can `parse()` it
    -   `size`: size of this instruction
    -   `mnemonic`: string representation of instruction mnemonic
    -   `opStr`: string representation of instruction operands
    -   `operands`: array of objects describing each operand, each specifying
                    the `type` and `value`, at a minimum, but potentially also
                    additional properties depending on the architecture
    -   `regsRead`: array of register names implicitly read by this instruction
    -   `regsWritten`: array of register names implicitly written to by this
        instruction
    -   `groups`: array of group names that this instruction belongs to
    -   `toString()`: convert to a human-readable string

    For details about `operands` and `groups`, please consult the
    **[Capstone](http://www.capstone-engine.org/)** documentation for your
    architecture.


### X86Writer

    The second argument is an optional options object where the initial program
    counter may be specified, which is useful when generating code to a scratch
    buffer. This is essential when using [`Memory.patchCode()`](#memory-patchcode)
    on iOS, which may provide you with a temporary location that later gets mapped
    into memory at the intended memory location.

-   `reset(codeAddress[, { pc: ptr('0x1234') }])`: recycle instance

-   `dispose()`: eagerly clean up memory

-   `flush()`: resolve label references and write pending data to memory. You
    should always call this once you've finished generating code. It is usually
    also desirable to do this between pieces of unrelated code, e.g. when
    generating multiple functions in one go.

-   `base`: memory location of the first byte of output, as a **[NativePointer](#nativepointer)**

-   `code`: memory location of the next byte of output, as a **[NativePointer](#nativepointer)**

-   `pc`: program counter at the next byte of output, as a **[NativePointer](#nativepointer)**

-   `offset`: current offset as a JavaScript Number

    ensures that the argument list is aligned on a 16 byte boundary

-   `putCallRegWithArguments(reg, args)`: put code needed for calling a C
    function with the specified `args`, specified as a JavaScript array where
    each element is either a string specifying the register, or a Number or

### X86Relocator

+   `new X86Relocator(inputCode, output)`: create a new code relocator for
    copying x86 instructions from one memory location to another, taking
    care to adjust position-dependent instructions accordingly.
    The source address is specified by `inputCode`, a **[NativePointer](#nativepointer)**.
    The destination is given by `output`, an **[X86Writer](#x86writer)** pointed
    at the desired target memory address.

-   `reset(inputCode, output)`: recycle instance

-   `dispose()`: eagerly clean up memory

-   `input`: latest **[Instruction](#instruction)** read so far. Starts out `null`
    and changes on every call to [`readOne()`](#x86relocator-readone).

-   `eob`: boolean indicating whether end-of-block has been reached, i.e. we've
    reached a branch of any kind, like CALL, JMP, BL, RET.

-   `eoi`: boolean indicating whether end-of-input has been reached, e.g. we've
    reached JMP/B/RET, an instruction after which there may or may not be valid
    code.

-   `readOne()`: read the next instruction into the relocator's internal buffer
    and return the number of bytes read so far, including previous calls.
    You may keep calling this method to keep buffering, or immediately call
    either [`writeOne()`](#x86relocator-writeone) or [`skipOne()`](#x86relocator-skipone).
    Or, you can buffer up until the desired point and then call [`writeAll()`](#x86relocator-writeall).
    Returns zero when end-of-input is reached, which means the `eoi` property is
    now `true`.
    {: #x86relocator-readone}

-   `peekNextWriteInsn()`: peek at the next **[Instruction](#instruction)** to be
    written or skipped

-   `peekNextWriteSource()`: peek at the address of the next instruction to be
    written or skipped

    {: #x86relocator-skipone}

-   `skipOneNoLabel()`: skip the instruction that would have been written next,
    but without a label for internal use. This breaks relocation of branches to
    locations inside the relocated range, and is an optimization for use-cases
    where all branches are rewritten (e.g. Frida's **[Stalker](#stalker)**).

-   `writeOne()`: write the next buffered instruction
    {: #x86relocator-writeone}

-   `writeOneNoLabel()`: write the next buffered instruction, but without a
    label for internal use. This breaks relocation of branches to locations

### Arm64Relocator

+   `new Arm64Relocator(inputCode, output)`: create a new code relocator for
    copying AArch64 instructions from one memory location to another, taking
    care to adjust position-dependent instructions accordingly.
    The source address is specified by `inputCode`, a **[NativePointer](#nativepointer)**.
    The destination is given by `output`, an **[Arm64Writer](#arm64writer)** pointed
    at the desired target memory address.

-   `reset(inputCode, output)`: recycle instance

-   `dispose()`: eagerly clean up memory

-   `input`: latest **[Instruction](#instruction)** read so far. Starts out `null`
    and changes on every call to [`readOne()`](#arm64relocator-readone).

-   `eob`: boolean indicating whether end-of-block has been reached, i.e. we've
    reached a branch of any kind, like CALL, JMP, BL, RET.

-   `eoi`: boolean indicating whether end-of-input has been reached, e.g. we've
    reached JMP/B/RET, an instruction after which there may or may not be valid
    code.

-   `readOne()`: read the next instruction into the relocator's internal buffer
    and return the number of bytes read so far, including previous calls.
    You may keep calling this method to keep buffering, or immediately call
    either [`writeOne()`](#arm64relocator-writeone) or [`skipOne()`](#arm64relocator-skipone).
    Or, you can buffer up until the desired point and then call [`writeAll()`](#arm64relocator-writeall).
    Returns zero when end-of-input is reached, which means the `eoi` property is
    now `true`.
    {: #arm64relocator-readone}

-   `peekNextWriteInsn()`: peek at the next **[Instruction](#instruction)** to be
    written or skipped

-   `peekNextWriteSource()`: peek at the address of the next instruction to be
    written or skipped

-   `skipOne()`: skip the instruction that would have been written next
    {: #arm64relocator-skipone}

### MipsWriter

+   `new MipsWriter(codeAddress[, { pc: ptr('0x1234') }])`: create a new code
    writer for generating MIPS machine code written directly to memory at
    `codeAddress`, specified as a **[NativePointer](#nativepointer)**.
    The second argument is an optional options object where the initial program
    counter may be specified, which is useful when generating code to a scratch
    buffer. This is essential when using [`Memory.patchCode()`](#memory-patchcode)
    on iOS, which may provide you with a temporary location that later gets mapped
    into memory at the intended memory location.

-   `reset(codeAddress[, { pc: ptr('0x1234') }])`: recycle instance

-   `dispose()`: eagerly clean up memory

-   `flush()`: resolve label references and write pending data to memory. You
    should always call this once you've finished generating code. It is usually
    also desirable to do this between pieces of unrelated code, e.g. when
    generating multiple functions in one go.

-   `base`: memory location of the first byte of output, as a **[NativePointer](#nativepointer)**

-   `code`: memory location of the next byte of output, as a **[NativePointer](#nativepointer)**

-   `pc`: program counter at the next byte of output, as a **[NativePointer](#nativepointer)**

-   `offset`: current offset as a JavaScript Number

-   `skip(nBytes)`: skip `nBytes`

    function with the specified `args`, specified as a JavaScript array where
    each element is either a string specifying the register, or a Number or
    **[NativePointer](#nativepointer)** specifying the immediate value.

-   `putCallRegWithArguments(reg, args)`: put code needed for calling a C
    function with the specified `args`, specified as a JavaScript array where
    each element is either a string specifying the register, or a Number or
    **[NativePointer](#nativepointer)** specifying the immediate value.

## Others

### Console

+   `console.log(line)`, `console.warn(line)`, `console.error(line)`:
    write `line` to the console of your Frida-based application. The exact
    behavior depends on where [frida-core](https://github.com/frida/frida-core)
    is integrated.
    For example, this output goes to *stdout* or *stderr* when using Frida
    through [frida-python](https://github.com/frida/frida-python),
    **[qDebug](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qdebug.html)** when using
    **[frida-qml](https://github.com/frida/frida-qml)**, etc.

    Arguments that are **[ArrayBuffer](#arraybuffer)** objects will be substituted by
    the result of [`hexdump()`](#hexdump) with default options.

### Hexdump

+   `hexdump(target[, options])`: generate a hexdump from the provided
    **[ArrayBuffer](#arraybuffer)** or [NativePointer](#nativepointer) `target`,
    optionally with `options` for customizing the output.

    For example:

{% highlight js %}
const libc = Module.findBaseAddress('libc.so');
console.log(hexdump(libc, {
  offset: 0,
  length: 64,
  header: true,
  ansi: true
}));
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight sh %}
           0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  A  B  C  D  E  F  0123456789ABCDEF
00000000  7f 45 4c 46 01 01 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  .ELF............
00000010  03 00 28 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 34 00 00 00  ..(.........4...
00000020  34 a8 04 00 00 00 00 05 34 00 20 00 08 00 28 00  4.......4. ...(.
00000030  1e 00 1d 00 06 00 00 00 34 00 00 00 34 00 00 00  ........4...4...
{% endhighlight %}

### Shorthand

+   `int64(v)`: short-hand for [`new Int64(v)`](#int64)

+   `uint64(v)`: short-hand for [`new UInt64(v)`](#uint64)

+   `ptr(s)`: short-hand for [`new NativePointer(s)`](#nativepointer)

+   `NULL`: short-hand for `ptr("0")`

### Communication between host and injected process

+   `recv([type, ]callback)`: request `callback` to be called on the next
    message received from your Frida-based application. Optionally `type` may
    be specified to only receive a message where the `type` field is set to
    `type`.
    {: #communication-recv}

    This will only give you one message, so you need to call `recv()` again
    to receive the next one.

+   `send(message[, data])`: send the JavaScript object `message` to your
    Frida-based application (it must be serializable to JSON). If you also have
    some raw binary data that you'd like to send along with it, e.g. you dumped
    some memory using [`NativePointer#readByteArray`](#nativepointer-readbytearray),
    then you may pass this through the optional `data` argument. This requires it to
    either be an **[ArrayBuffer](#arraybuffer)** or an array of integers between
    0 and 255.
    {: #communication-send}

    <div class="note">
    <h5>Performance considerations</h5>
    <p>
        While <i>send()</i> is asynchronous, the total overhead of sending a single
        message is not optimized for high frequencies, so that means Frida leaves
        it up to you to batch multiple values into a single <i>send()</i>-call,
        based on whether low delay or high throughput is desired.
    </p>
    </div>

+   `rpc.exports`: empty object that you can either replace or insert into to
    expose an RPC-style API to your application. The key specifies the method
    name and the value is your exported function. This function may either
    return a plain value for returning that to the caller immediately, or a
    Promise for returning asynchronously.
    {: #rpc-exports}

>   For example:

{% highlight js %}
rpc.exports = {
  add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
  },
  sub(a, b) {
    return new Promise(resolve => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        resolve(a - b);
      }, 100);
    });
  }
};
{% endhighlight %}

>   From an application using the Node.js bindings this API would be consumed
>   like this:

{% highlight js %}
const frida = require('frida');
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const util = require('util');

const readFile = util.promisify(fs.readFile);

let session, script;
async function run() {
  const source = await readFile(path.join(__dirname, '_agent.js'), 'utf8');
  session = await frida.attach('iTunes');
  script = await session.createScript(source);
  script.message.connect(onMessage);
  await script.load();
  console.log(await script.exports.add(2, 3));
  console.log(await script.exports.sub(5, 3));
}

run().catch(onError);

function onError(error) {
  console.error(error.stack);
}

function onMessage(message, data) {
  if (message.type === 'send') {
    console.log(message.payload);
  } else if (message.type === 'error') {
    console.error(message.stack);
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

>   The Python version would be very similar:

{% highlight py %}
import codecs
import frida

def on_message(message, data):
    if message['type'] == 'send':
        print(message['payload'])
    elif message['type'] == 'error':
        print(message['stack'])

session = frida.attach('iTunes')
with codecs.open('./agent.js', 'r', 'utf-8') as f:
    source = f.read()
script = session.create_script(source)
script.on('message', on_message)
script.load()
print(script.exports.add(2, 3))
print(script.exports.sub(5, 3))
session.detach()
{% endhighlight %}

In the example above we used `script.on('message', on_message)` to monitor for
any messages from the injected process, JavaScript side.  There are other
notifications that you can watch for as well on both the `script` and `session`.
If you want to be notified when the target process exits, use
`session.on('detached', your_function)`.

### Timing events

+   `setTimeout(func, delay[, ...parameters])`: call `func` after `delay`
    milliseconds, optionally passing it one or more `parameters`.
    Returns an id that can be passed to `clearTimeout` to cancel it.

+   `clearTimeout(id)`: cancel id returned by call to `setTimeout`.

+   `setInterval(func, delay[, ...parameters])`: call `func` every `delay`
    milliseconds, optionally passing it one or more `parameters`.
    Returns an id that can be passed to `clearInterval` to cancel it.

+   `clearInterval(id)`: cancel id returned by call to `setInterval`.

+   `setImmediate(func[, ...parameters])`: schedules `func` to be called on
    Frida's JavaScript thread as soon as possible, optionally passing it one
    or more `parameters`.
    Returns an id that can be passed to `clearImmediate` to cancel it.

+   `clearImmediate(id)`: cancel id returned by call to `setImmediate`.

### Garbage collection

+   `gc()`: force garbage collection. Useful for testing, especially logic
    involving [`Script.bindWeak()`](#bindweak).
