It's release-o-clock, and Frida 1.2.0 is finally out! Bugfixes aside, this
release introduces brand new ARM64 support, which is quite useful for those of
you using Frida on your iPhone 5S or iPad Air. You can now inject into both 64-
and 32-bit processes, just like on Mac and Windows.

This release also improves stability on ARM32, where attaching to short
functions used to result in undefined behavior.

Enjoy!
