Did anyone say Android? Frida 1.4.0 is out, with brand new Android support!
Have a look at the documentation [here](/docs/android/)
to get started. Also new in this release is that Frida is now powered by
the amazing [Capstone Disassembly Engine](http://www.capstone-engine.org/),
which means our cross-platform code instrumentation is even more powerful.
It also paves the way for taking the x86-only [stealth tracing](https://github.com/frida/frida-gum/blob/41dbb1d27a784fd8b5e233929a317cd41beb9c2d/tests/core/arch-x86/stalker-x86.c#L78)
to new architectures in future releases.

Enjoy!
