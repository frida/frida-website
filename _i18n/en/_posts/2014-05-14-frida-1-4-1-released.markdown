Interested in spawning processes on Windows or Linux, and not just on Mac? Or
maybe you've been bitten by the Linux injector crashing your processes instead
of letting you inject into them? Or maybe you had a function name that was so
long that frida-trace overflowed the max filename length on Windows? Well, if
any of the above, or none of it, then Frida 1.4.1 is for you!

Thanks to Guillaume and Pedro for making this release awesome. Keep those pull-
requests and bug reports coming!
