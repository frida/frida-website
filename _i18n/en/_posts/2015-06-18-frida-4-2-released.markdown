The Frida co-conspirators have been cracking away on several fronts, so much
lately that I figured it was worth jotting this down to get the word out.

In Dalvik land, [@marc1006](https://github.com/marc1006) contributed a really
neat new feature â€“ the ability to do object carving, essentially scanning the
heap for objects of a certain type. Check this out:

{% highlight js %}
const strings = [];
Dalvik.choose('java.lang.String', {
  onMatch: function (str) {
    strings.push(str);
  },
  onComplete: function () {
    console.log('Found ' + strings.length + ' strings!');
  }
});
{% endhighlight %}

Meanwhile, [@Tyilo](https://github.com/Tyilo) has been rocking out adding the
same feature for Objective-C:

{% highlight js %}
const strings = [];
ObjC.choose(ObjC.classes.NSString, {
  onMatch: function (str) {
    strings.push(str);
  },
  onComplete: function () {
    console.log('Found ' + strings.length + ' strings!');
  }
});
{% endhighlight %}

In other mobile news, [@pancake](https://github.com/trufae) added support for
enumerating applications on Firefox OS. Sweet!

While all of this was going on, [@s1341](https://github.com/s1341) has been
hard at work stabilizing the QNX port, and it's reportedly working really well
now.

On my end I have been applying Frida to interesting challenges at
[NowSecure](https://www.nowsecure.com/), and ran into quite a few bugs and
limitations in the Objective-C integration. There's now support for overriding
methods that deal with struct types passed by value, e.g. `-[UIView drawRect:]`,
which means `NativeFunction` and `NativeCallback` also support these; so for
declaring a struct simply start an array with the fields' types specified
sequentially. You can even nest them. So for the `- drawRect:` case where a
struct is passed by value, and that struct is made out of two other structs,
you'd declare it like this:

{% highlight js %}
const f = new NativeFunction(ptr('0x1234'), 'void',
    [[['double', 'double'], ['double', 'double']]]);
{% endhighlight %}

Another thing worth mentioning is that a long-standing issue especially visible
when instrumenting 32-bit iOS apps, but affecting all platforms, has finally
[been fixed](https://github.com/frida/frida-gum/commit/2f02e911edc4a5df80051fdaed72e0281ea751e7).

That's all for now. Please help spread the word by sharing this post across
the inter-webs. We're still quite small as an open source project, so
word-of-mouth marketing means a lot to us.

Enjoy!
