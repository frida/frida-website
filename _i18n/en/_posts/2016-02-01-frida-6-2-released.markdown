It's release o'clock, and this time we're bringing you massive performance
improvements on all platforms, a brand new API for looking up functions, and
major stability improvements on iOS 9.

Let's talk about the latter subject first. Some of you may have noticed weird
bugs and deadlocks when using Frida on iOS 9. The root cause was simply that our
inline hooking was causing the process to lose the *CS_VALID* bit of its
[code-signing status](https://github.com/frida/frida-gum/blob/ae22e0fa94970a9df140757e4aa0467e9deea9aa/tests/core/interceptor.c#L1111).
This was not a problem on iOS 8 and older as jailbreaks were always able to
patch the kernel to loosen up on its code-signing requirements. Starting with
this release we have implemented some tricks to be able to do inline hooking
without breaking the code-signing status. For the technically curious this means
that we dynamically generate a .dylib as a temporary file, write out the new
versions of the memory pages that we'd like to modify, e.g. the libc memory page
containing *open()*, then pseudo-sign this binary, ask the kernel to [F_ADDFILESIGS](https://github.com/frida/frida-gum/blob/ae22e0fa94970a9df140757e4aa0467e9deea9aa/gum/backend-darwin/gumcodesegment-darwin.c#L211)
to it, and finally *mmap()* from this file on top of the original memory pages.

This brings us to the next topic: performance. The tricks that I just talked
about do actually add quite a bit of extra overhead just to hook one single
function. It is also a very different approach from what we can do on systems
with support for read-write-execute memory-pages and relaxed code-signing
requirements, so this obviously meant that major architectural changes were
needed. I had also been thinking for a while about being able to apply a whole
batch of hooks in one go, allowing us to be more efficient and have more control
on exactly when hooks are activated.

Starting with this release, our Interceptor API now supports [transactions](https://github.com/frida/frida-gum/blob/ae22e0fa94970a9df140757e4aa0467e9deea9aa/gum/guminterceptor.h#L78-L79).
Simply call *begin_transaction()*, hook all the functions, and make them all
active in one go by calling *end_transaction()*. This results in a massive
performance boost, and you get all of this for free without any changes to your
existing code. This is because we implicitly begin a transaction whenever we're
entering the JavaScript runtime, and end it when we're leaving it (and just
before we *send()* a message or return from an RPC method). So unless you're
attaching your hooks from timers or asynchronous APIs like *Memory.scan()*,
they will all be batched into a single transaction and get a performance boost.

Here's how we stack up to CydiaSubstrate in terms of performance:

Note that if you're using our instrumentation engine from C or C++ you will
have to call *begin_transaction()* and *end_transaction()* yourself to get this
boost, but your code will still work even if you don't, because every operation
will implicitly contain a transaction, and the API allows nesting those calls.

That was function hooking performance, but we didn't stop there. If you've ever
used *frida-trace* to trace Objective-C APIs, or glob for functions across all
loaded libraries, you may have noticed that it could take quite a while to
resolve all the functions. If you combined this with early instrumentation it
could even take so long that we exceeded the system's [launch timeout](https://github.com/frida/frida/issues/103).
All of this has now been optimized, and to give you an idea of the speed-up,
a typical Objective-C case that used to take seconds is now completing in a
few milliseconds.

Now to the final part of the news. Considering that dynamically discovering
functions to hook is such a common use-case, and not just something that
*frida-trace* does, we now have a [brand new API](https://www.frida.re/docs/javascript-api/#apiresolver)
for just that:

![ApiResolver #2](/img/api-resolver-objc.png "ApiResolver")

So in closing, here's a summary of the changes:

6.2.0:

- core: improve Interceptor to avoid breaking dynamic code-signing on iOS 9
- core: move to a transaction-based Interceptor API for improved performance
- core: fix crash when scheduled callbacks are freed late (V8 and Duktape)
- frida-trace: improve performance by removing *setTimeout()* logic, allowing
               many hooks to be applied in the same transaction
- frida-trace: batch log events in 50 ms chunks to improve performance

6.2.1:

- core: add *ApiResolver* API
- frida-trace: improve performance by using the new *ApiResolver* API

6.2.2:

- core: fix oops that prevented injection into Windows Store/Universal apps
- core: fix crash on teardown on 32-bit ARM
- core: add frida-inject, a tool to inject an agent into a running process with
        similar semantics to frida-gadget
- core: (Linux) prevent libdl from unloading to work around TLS destructor bug
- core: (Linux) fix race-condition on rapid uninject

6.2.3:

- core: fix source-map handling for eval code, which manifested itself as
        unhandled exceptions getting swallowed, e.g. when running frida-trace
- core: fix Python 3.x build system regression
- frida-trace: fix path escaping issue
- frida-trace: improve error-handling for bad handlers

6.2.4:

- frida-trace: monitor handlers instead of polling them

6.2.5:

- core: add support for hooking arbitrary instructions by calling
        *Interceptor.attach()* with a function instead of a callbacks object
- core: add support for detaching individual listeners added by
        *Interceptor.attach()*, even synchronously from their callbacks
- core: add *Memory.scanSync()*
- core: fix clobber by improving *Interceptor* to preserve *r12* aka *IP* on ARM
- core: expose *r8* through *r12* to the JavaScript runtimes
- core: fix crash on architectures where unaligned word access is not supported
- frida-repl: simplify logic by using the RPC feature
- node: upgrade to prebuild 3.x

6.2.6:

- core: fix regression on non-jailbroken iOS systems
- core: fix Interceptor regression in the Duktape runtime
- core: fix module name of resolved imports
- core: add API for specifying which host to connect to
- core: improve QNX support and fix build regressions
- core: fix the frida-inject build system on Mac
- core: (Windows) fix crash when USB device location retrieval fails
- frida-server: allow overriding the default listen address
- frida-node: add *addRemoteDevice()* and *removeRemoteDevice()* to
              DeviceManager
- frida-python: add -H switch for specifying the host to connect to
- frida-python: add *add_remote_device()* and *remove_remote_device()* to
                DeviceManager
- frida-python: fix compatibility issues with the Duktape runtime
- frida-python: canonicalize the requested RPC method name

Enjoy!
