Some of you may be aware that Frida has two JavaScript runtimes, one based
on [V8](https://developers.google.com/v8/), and another one based on [Duktape](http://duktape.org/).
We also used to have a runtime based on [JavaScriptCore](https://trac.webkit.org/wiki/JavaScriptCore),
but it got retired when our Duktape runtime proved better in all of the
situations where V8 wasn't a good fit, e.g. on tiny embedded systems and
systems where RWX pages are forbidden.

Anyway, what is pretty neat is that Duktape has an API for compiling to
bytecode, allowing you to cache the compiled code and save precious startup time
when it's time to instrument a new process. Starting with this release we now
have brand new API for compiling your JavaScript to bytecode, and of course
instantiating a script from it. This API is not yet supported in our V8 runtime,
but we should be able to implement it there after our next V8 upgrade, by using
the WebAssembly infrastructure that started appearing in the latest releases.

So without further ado, let's take this new API for a spin with the Duktape
runtime by forcing Frida to favor Duktape through *Session.disable_jit()*.

From Node.js:

{% highlight js %}
const co = require('co');
const frida = require('frida');

co(function* () {
  const systemSession = yield frida.attach(0);
  yield systemSession.disableJit();
  const bytecode = yield systemSession.compileScript(`
    rpc.exports = {
      listThreads: function () {
        return Process.enumerateThreadsSync();
      }
    };
  `);

  const session = yield frida.attach('Twitter');
  yield session.disableJit();
  const script = yield session.createScriptFromBytes(bytecode);
  yield script.load();

  const api = yield script.getExports();
  console.log('api.listThreads() =>', yield api.listThreads());

  yield script.unload();
})
.catch(err => {
  console.error(err);
});
{% endhighlight %}

And from Python:

{% highlight python %}
from __future__ import print_function
import frida

system_session = frida.attach(0)
system_session.disable_jit()
bytecode = system_session.compile_script("""
rpc.exports = {
  listThreads: function () {
    return Process.enumerateThreadsSync();
  }
};
""")

session = frida.attach("Twitter")
session.disable_jit()
script = session.create_script_from_bytes(bytecode)
script.load()

api = script.exports
print("api.list_threads() =>", api.list_threads())
{% endhighlight %}

Note that the same caveats as [specified in the Duktape documentation](http://duktape.org/api.html#duk_load_function)
apply here, so make sure the code you're trying to load is well-formed and
generated by the same version of Duktape. It may get upgraded when you upgrade
to a future version of Frida, but will at least be architecture-neutral; i.e.
you can compile to bytecode on a 64-bit x86 desktop and load it just fine in
a 32-bit iOS app on ARM.

So that's bytecode compilation through the API, but you probably want to use the [frida-compile](https://github.com/frida/frida-compile)
CLI tool for this instead:

{% highlight bash %}
$ npm install frida-compile
$ ./node_modules/.bin/frida-compile agent.js -o agent.bin -b
{% endhighlight %}

While developing you can also use it in watch mode by adding *-w*, which makes
it watch the inputs and perform fast incremental builds whenever one of them
changes.

Whether you're using bytecode (*-b*) or not, frida-compile is highly recommended
as it also comes with a number of other benefits, letting you:

- Split your script into multiple .js files by using *require()*.
- Leverage thousands of existing modules from npm, including some that are
  Frida-specific. For example:
  [frida-trace](https://github.com/nowsecure/frida-trace),
  [frida-uikit](https://github.com/nowsecure/frida-uikit),
  [frida-screenshot](https://github.com/nowsecure/frida-screenshot), etc.
- Use ES6 syntax and have your code compiled to ES5 so it's compatible with
  the Duktape runtime.
