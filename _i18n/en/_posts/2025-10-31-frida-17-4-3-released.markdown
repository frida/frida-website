Spooky season brought a small batch of fixes and improvements:

- simmy: Gracefully degrade features that rely on injecting into SpringBoard
  whenever System Integrity Protection (SIP) is enabled. This means that
  `get_frontmost_application()` and icon retrieval now fall back rather than
  exploding.

- simmy: Fix enumeration of installed apps when a subset of bundle IDs was
  requested. Hat-tip to [@hsorbo][] for the assist!

- docs: Update the READMEâ€™s Apple-certificate section to reflect the current
  reality. Thanks to [@gemesa][] for spotting and fixing the outdated bits!

Enjoy, and happy hacking!
