Small but important update for our Darwin users:

- darwin: Revive app listing/launching on iOS â‰¥ 16 when running on rootful
  systems. This brings frida-core commit dccb612 back to life after 8108d4d
  broke it while fixing two Interceptor singleton leaks. It turns out the
  leak in springboard.m was intentional, acting as init-once logic with no
  teardown expected; without it, the instrumentation we apply gets reverted
  right away. Kudos to [@alexhude][] for the heads-up.
